<div class="message">Until a few days ago, IDM was my iPlayer downloader of choice. Then it suddenly stopped working, presumably due to the latest iPlayer update. So I went looking for an alternative and I discovered get_iplayer. I just tried it for the first time and it works very well. I am grateful to have found this software and I would like to express my thanks to those who have taken the time and trouble to create it. This kind of thing does not always receive the appreciation it deserves.<br />
<br />
I have two additional comments. First, I do not understand at all the complaints of those who say this software is difficult to use. I am no expert but a quick glance at the extremely clear and well-written guide was all I needed to immediately download what I wanted. It worked beautifully, simple, smooth, no problems at all. How anyone could not understand how to do this completely mystifies me. Even if you have never used a command line interface before, it is not difficult to work out. <br />
<br />
My second comment is not a criticism, just an observation, and that is that the download was considerably slower than what I have been used to with IDM. Is the content being streamed? It seems very similar to VLC in that regard. <br />
<br />
To anyone who still has trouble understanding how this works, just use a browser on the site to get the PID of the item you want, open a  command line interface and type get_iplayer --pid=whatever. It's not rocket science. <br />
<br />
Thanks again to the developers of this.</div>

Everything else being equal, it is obvious which one will be faster. If speed is paramount, stick to IDM.</div>
