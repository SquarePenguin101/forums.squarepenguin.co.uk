<div class="message">Good afternoon<br />
<br />
Just trying to download Get_Iplayer for Win10 upgraded laptop, but can't access <a href="http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win/get_iplayer_setup_latest.exe">http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win...latest.exe</a><br />
<br />
Does anyone have a copy of the lastest version they can dropbox for me please?</div>

<div class="message">Confirmed. It seems that the DNS server has fallen over and bumped its head. You can still get to the site through one of the IP addresses:<br />

Middle one works for me. However, I can't get the installer .exe using those IPs but that could be for other reason I guess.</div>

<div class="message">The installer downloads get_iplayer scripts from infradead.org, so it's useless if the site is down.  The site has been down before, but never more than 2-3 days.  Give it some time.  I presume the site owner knows about the problem since a number of projects are hosted there, but as SP said, this appears to be a DNS problem, so it may be out of the owner's hands for the moment.<br />
<br />
EDIT: As SP says below, mailing list is probably not an option</div>

Yup, foiled by this too - trawled thru various external HDD to find the last download and got temporarily excited!</div>

<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>Or is there a way to get the Windows version from an other server?</blockquote>
Not really. As SquarePenguin said above, the installer connects to infradead to download things like rtmpdump and ffmpeg so it's not just a case of moving the installer to a different place.</div>

<div class="message">We don't know I'm afraid. <br />
<br />
The server that hosts the installer and installation scripts is being physically moved and it isn't affiliated with me here in any way. Indications were it would only be a couple of days but as we see it's been 5 and it's still no back up.<br />
<br />
Because the installer relies on the infradead.org server for certain installation scripts getting and using a copy of the installer would not offer a workaround. The installer needs that server.<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful the infradead.org server will be back up soon but as I said, that server is totally independent of us here so we don't have any info on it's likely restoration.</div>

That's right. Apparently it wasn't supposed to be down at all as it's on a different server but for whatever reason the move of the main server took down the lists MX records for list for that period.<br />
<br />
To answer your earlier question about hosting the installer, I have offered to do that but it's not the work of a moment to rework the installer. It is on Dinky's radar for future consideration though. <br />

That's interesting, I had assumed that that site was hosted by Phil Lewis and wasn't on David Woodhouse's infrastructure.</div>

<div class="message">If the infradead.org site is still offline at close of play on Wednesday, I'll post a standalone installer.  I may do it regardless of whether the site has returned. I don't want to change the installer between releases because it requires time better spent doing more enjoyable things such as poking a stick in my eye. But as SP mentioned, this issue has been on my radar, so even a quick hack would be a move in the right direction.</div>
