<div class="message">It's never worked outside the UK (EDIT: For TV). BBC iPlayer is a geo-restricted service that requires a UK IP address to access. This is nothing to do with get_iplayer but a function of the BBC iPlayer service itself.<br />
<br />
The message you are seeing is simply due to a change to the error message in the recent release informing you that the error may be because you are outside the UK. Previously there was no error message but the download failed still. So, the reason you didn't see it before is because it didn't exist, not because get_iplayer is restricting you.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I see this was about Radio, my bad for making the assumption it was TV. Radio should work after updating to the latest version of get_iplayer.</div>

<div class="message">Actually it's been working wonderfully up until last week. I have been abroad for some time and using get_iplayer, but starting end of last week it suddenly failed to fetch. It began with a few programmes, that identified the programme but failed to download saying I shouild try another mode eg mode=wma because 'default' was not available. The mode didnt work. Now nothing downloads anymore and the message I get is:<br />
<br />

<br />
I tried the mode suggestion but it doesnt work. It says recording complete but nothign was recorded. What could then be the problem? I had this message for CD Review last week, but other programme in that week downloaded successfully.<br />
<br />
thanks for ur advice<br />
cheers</div>

<div class="message">Well, latest is i updated to the latest version and everything is now hunky dory. Sorry for not checking, I swear I had downloaded the latest version. I guess the message about being outside UK threw me off. Tks again for a wonderful tool, makes life so much easier to enjoy radio, and keep my blood pressure from going red ;)<br />

<div class="message">Hi.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd mention that I have also had that same message - that I'm 'outside the UK' when I tried to download a programme called Hinterland. I'm not outside it btw. I did try to download it several times and always got the same message. But, I wasn't using V2.92 either so that might have had something to do with it?<br />
<br />
The message has also popped up a couple of times on other programmes I've tried to download too, but I can't be<ul class="mycode_list"><li>100%</li>
</ul>
 sure I did it right those times.</div>

<div class="message">The message indicates you "may" be outside the UK.  Your problem is that you haven't upgraded.</div>
