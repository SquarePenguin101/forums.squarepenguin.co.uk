<div class="message">Hi. Great little app, thanks.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded a number of programs using it with no problem but on the last download its adding 'default.mp4.flv' to the download. This makes it unplayable with Windows Media Player and I find WMP to be the better player for quality.<br />
<br />
I have tried simply deleting the .flv but this makes no difference to playing with WMP.<br />
<br />
Anyone with a bit more experience/knowledge than me know what's going on and if I can sort this?<br />
<br />
All help appreciated, thanks</div>

<div class="message">I've managed to get it to download again the way I want by deleting the get_iplayer installation and reinstalling. I did this as when I went to download the file again get_iplayer returned that this was already in my history. I'm sure there must be an easier way to deal with that but I couldn't see it so just reinstalled.<br />
<br />
After reinstalling I downloaded the program again and looked at the actual download as it was in the process of being downloaded and noticed it still had the 'default.mp4.flv' on it. I allowed it to complete and ,yay, it  'converted' the download to the .mp4.<br />
<br />
I think the problem was of my own making as I must have interrupted the initial download before that final 'convert' bit.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back to normal and again thanks to the devs for this program. Its a massive help as I was playing the program I wanted in real time from the BBC iPlayer page and using NVidia's build in Shadowplay to record it in real time and though Shadowplay has a great quality it takes as long as each program is to record :)</div>

<div class="message">Your analysis is probably correct regarding interrupting the conversion. <br />
<br />
Next time, you can use the <kbd>--force</kbd> command to force get_iplayer to download a file that already exists in the history. No need to reinstall.</div>
