<div class="message">Got to say that this afternoon was pretty frustrating when I posted a problem: <a href="/thread-1204.html">/thread-1204.html</a><br />
<br />
I thought it too much of a coincidence that I updated my Raspberry and Gip wouldn't download anything at all.<br />
I posted and it was immediately assumed that my problem was due to recent metadata problem posted today however, I did post more information that indicated that it wasn't just missing metadata it was complete failure to download anything.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I was confused by the fact that when I posted my problem, unbeknownst to me at the time I reposted because the post was already gone when I went to edit it - it told me it didn't exist. I reposted 3 times (sorry for that but I didn't know you were responding with the link and then deleting it - how could I know). Finally the last one was left intact with a link to the metadata problem, but the thread was immediately locked.<br />
<br />
Thing was that this wasn't the problem and it was truly to do with the update. I finally found the reason for the problem here <a href="http://packages.hedgerows.org.uk/">http://packages.hedgerows.org.uk/</a> where it was stated that wheezy isn't supported anymore and once I re-installed the Jessie version via the supplied script it all works now although YES the metadata is missing but I am getting the correct videos with no names. <br />
<br />
That's fine but it was a bit frustrating that I was completely blocked from explaining why my problem was not that of just missing metadata - output I posted clearly showed that <br />
<br />
"<br />

although I admit that the fact I also showed the metadata message I didn't make it clear that it was not finding the pid.</div>

<div class="message">Sorry you got caught in the thread freezes. <br />
<br />
What you posted in the first half was a duplicate of the metadata threads. Indeed, your first code output said it clearly:<br />
<br />
<div class="gipcodeblock">
<h3 class="giptitle">get_iplayer Output:</h3><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>WARNING: Could not download programme metadata from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08jpcds.xml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08jpcds.xml</a><br />
<br />
ERROR: Failed to get version pid metadata from iplayer site</code></div>
</div>
<br />
and...<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>I'm pretty sure it's due to the upgrade as I've been downloading fine up to that.</blockquote>
<br />
It was known that this issue wasn't caused by an update and I didn't read past that (sorry) as that was enough to be a duplicate thread. <br />
<br />
The second half of your issue is valid though and I'm glad you sorted it. <br />
<br />
For future threads, we provide a voluminous guide on posting the relevant data in order to receive the best support:<br />

<div class="message">No problem, I  do understand how easy it was to get caught in the net with Dinky posting his announcement only 2 hours before I created my thread.<br />
<br />
thanks for pointing me to the link, I'll be sure to follow that if I have any issues in the future. For now I'm happy to be getting the downloads with a small amount adjustment using the name prefix to get the titles right.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
