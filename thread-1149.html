<div class="message">This is a strange one and I apologise if it is already here somewhere (I have searched on the forum, checked the guides etc.).<br />
<br />
I have a Windows 10 system with the latest version of Get_iPlayer, well two in fact. My current system works perfectly well (but I had to completely disable UAC to get the files downloading anywhere outside of my user folders), but my new system (with UAC intact and using a standard Administractor profile instead of the "hidden" admin profile) appears to be working when I refresh the cache, shows files being identified but then shows nothing in the list of available programmes.<br />
<br />
I did have this before on my old system but after either a windows update or a Get_iPlayer update, but can't remember what I did to resolve it.<br />
I use Firefox as the browser, have tried turning the Windows firewall off and can't think what to try next.<br />
Is this a browser issue or something with the system itself?<br />
Has anyone else seen this issue?<br />
I tried a fresh install of Get_iPlayer, also tried copying over files from my current system and then tried both again. I have tried cleaning up the "old" version repeatedly (because it says on installation that it was installed for a previous user) but can't see what else on my system is still befing referenced - I have deleted all files, edited registry entries and still it refers to a previous version.<br />
I'm not even sure that is what the problem is anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div>

It only warns you that <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">if</span> you're installing under a different account than you normally use with get_iplayer that you will need to complete the cleanup yourself. The whole point is that the installer doesn't know if the previous installation was done under a different account.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you mean by "shows files being identified", so you had better post a screenshot to show what is happening. You should also check whether or not you've merely screwed up your settings. Post the output from <kbd>get_iplayer --show-options</kbd>, and also try to do a search from the command prompt, e.g., <kbd>get_iplayer Taboo</kbd>. If that doesn't return results, the problem is in get_iplayer, not the Web PVR.</div>

<div class="message">** EDIT: I have found out what the issue is. I will post my original response intact because {a}I have gone to the effort of getting all the information for you and {b} it will give you and the other forum users a good laugh.<br />
The original response is below **<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, on my current (working) system, the "user" is my name, but the new system was set up with a user of "me". That was why I started getting the error message.<br />
However, I have followed the instructions to clear everything I could find of the Get_iPlayer installation from my new system and even then went through the steps to rename the "user" to match my current system, but I still seeing the same message each time I reinstall Get_iPlayer.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to answer your specific points, when I say "shows files being identified" I mean that performing a cache refresh shows radio programmes being added;<br />

<br />
But then when I go back to the search page and refresh that, it shopws nothing available:<br />

**EDIT: So, just in case you haven't spotted it, having done all this I theorised that as the command line search is clearly working, it might be something I have missed in the web PVR settings, so I fired it up again to double check.<br />
I noticed that the "channels containing" parameter was entered as "Radio4", not "Radio 4". So I added the space and refreshed the page.<br />
Guess what?<br />
Now I will log off and give myself a good slapping for missing something so obvious.<br />
<br />
Thank you anyway.<br />
<br />
p.s. - as the support for conversion to mp3 is showing as being 'deprecated' and likely to be removed in a future release, will there be a replacement setting to achieve the same thing?</div>

No, but there are many ways to convert files. See the FAQ list for a link to some suggestions.</div>
