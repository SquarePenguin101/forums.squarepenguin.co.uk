Franz Schubert: Impromptu in A flat major, Op. 142
 
Emanuel Ax, piano
Vienna Philharmonic
Bernard Haitink, conductor
 
It's hard to believe that Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, now a keystone of the piano repertoire, was almost completely ignored during the composer's lifetime. It took a new generation of musicians to fully appreciate both the innovative handling of the relationship between the soloist and the orchestra and the unique blend of drama and lyricism in the score. 

Two centuries on, the Concerto is among the most frequently played at the BBC Proms and the musicians performing the work this year have a particularly strong Beethoven pedigree: Bernard Haitink's life-time immersion in this work  - he turned 90 in March - shows in every concert while Emanuel Ax's Beethoven interpretations have been globally acclaimed for decades. The concert has an added significance as it's likely to be Haitink's last in the UK.
 
Presented from London's Royal Albert Hall by Andrew McGregor and Natasha Loges.

Presented by Christopher Cook

American organ virtuoso Cameron Carpenter brings his extraordinary manual and pedal dexterity to bear on the mighty Royal Albert Hall organ in the first two concerts exploring the works of the greatest composer for the instrument, JS Bach, and his own extraordinary improvisations.

Famous for his prodigious abilities and performance flair, Cameron Carpenter in these concerts plays Bach both in its original form and as viewed through the prism of other composers - including himself: the concert includes his reworking of part of a Bach solo violin partita. Alongside it are a chorale prelude arranged for piano by Busoni, and Henry Wood's and Busoni's arrangements of the famous D minor Toccata and Fugue re-imagined by Cameron Carpenter.

Bach: Toccata and Fugue in F major, BWV 540
Partita No. 3 in E major for solo violin, BWV 1006 - excerpt (arr. C. Carpenter)
Prelude and Fugue in A major, BWV 536
Chorale Prelude 'Nun freut euch, lieben Christen', BWV 734 (arr. Busoni/C. Carpenter)
Carpenter: Improvisation on B-A-C-H
Bach: \\"Evolutionary\\" Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, (arr. Wood, Busoni and Carpenter)

Cameron Carpenter (organ)

Live from the Royal Albert Hall.

Presented by Sara Mohr-Pietsch.

Bach: Orchestral Suite No. 4 in D major, BWV 1069
Bach: Orchestral Suite No. 1 in C major, BWV 1066

c. 8.25pm Interval. Sara Mohr-Pietsch explores the pivotal role that Henry Wood played in the revival of J.S. Bach's music at the turn of the 20th century, with guest musicologist Hannah French.

Bach: Orchestral Suite No. 2 in B minor, BWV 1067
Bach: Orchestral Suite No 3 in D major, BWV 1068


Bach specialist John Butt and his period-instrument Dunedin Consort continue our series of composer themed nights as a tribute to Proms founder conductor Henry Wood.
They pair Bach's four Orchestral Suites with four newly commissioned works taking inspiration from the suites' dance movements - providing both companions and contrasts.
Bach's suites are interspersed with four new works from Stuart MacRae, Nico Muhly, Ailie Robertson and Stevie Wishart (BBC co-commissions with the Dunedin Consort: world premieres).

Presented at the Royal Albert Hall by Martin Handley.

Smetana: The Bartered Bride - overture; Three Dances
Tchaikovsky: Eugene Onegin - Letter Scene

8.10pm
Interval Proms Plus 
A verbal correspondence about the function of letters in literature and life. PS - the speakers are best-selling crime novelist Ruth Ware and Shaun Usher, editor of the popular website Letters Of Note.  Hosted by New Generation Thinker Sophie Coulombeau. Produced by Zahid Warley.

Shostakovich: Symphony No 8 in C minor

Elena Stikhina (soprano)
Czech Philharmonic
Semyon Bychkov (conductor)

The dancing rhythms and swirling colours of Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride launch a concert of big musical gestures and even bigger emotions.

First love blazes hot in the Letter Scene from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin, as Tatyana (sung here by soprano Elena Stikhina) pours out her heart in music as romantic as anything the composer ever wrote.

War, not love, drives the pulsing heartbeat of Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony - the most personal and direct of the composer's many attempts 'to express the terrible tragedy of war'.

Jonny Greenwood's talents range from being lead guitarist of Radiohead to writing award-winning film scores. Here he curates a Late Night Prom culminating in the world premiere of his Horror vacui, which explores characteristics of electronically created music and transfers them into the acoustic arena.

The programme includes Biber's almost Bachian Passacaglia for solo violin and Minimalist master Steve Reich's radiantly throbbing Pulse.

Berlioz: Symphonie fantastique

Matthew Baynton (actor)
Aurora Orchestra
Nicholas Collon (conductor)

A diabolical witches' sabbath, a riotous ball, a march to the gallows and an unrequited passion make up the hallucinatory narrative of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique.

Inspired by the composer's own romantic infatuation with a young actress, the score is a cinematic fantasy full of tragedy and passion, a work teeming with orchestral drama - by turns gorgeous and grotesque.

Nicholas Collon and the Aurora Orchestra perform this grandiose work from memory, in a specially devised production incorporating elements of design, lighting and choreography, as well as Berlioz's own words about his music.

Staging concept by the Aurora Orchestra

Live from the Royal Albert Hall, London.
Presented by Martin Handley.

Handel:  Music for the Royal Fireworks
Beethoven: Aria 'Ah! perfido'
Bach (orch Elgar): Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 537

c. 8.15pm  Interval: Beethoven's only opera, Fidelio, and his Fifth Symphony are two of his most iconic works. Scholars Benjamin Walton and Laura Tunbridge examine the composer's social standing in the early years of the 19th century. Presented by Flora Willson.

c. 8.35pm
Beethoven: Fidelio - overture
Beethoven: Fidelio - 'Abscheulicher! ... Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern'
Symphony No 5 in C minor, Op. 67

Elizabeth Watts (soprano)
NDR Radio Philharmonic Orchestra
Andrew Manze (conductor)


Proms founder-conductor Henry Wood's tradition of composer-themed nights continues here with Beethoven.
The composer's revolutionary Fifth Symphony provides the climax of a programme that also includes music from his dramatic 'rescue' opera Fidelio.
Bach's music was a passion shared by Beethoven and Wood, and is represented here by Elgar's orchestration of the Fantasia and Fugue in C minor for organ.
