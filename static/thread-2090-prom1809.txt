Today, a whistlestop trip through the scanty facts of the composer's biography.

Frustratingly little is known about the tragically abbreviated life of the composer who is arguably Britain's greatest, Henry Purcell. Had he been born twenty years earlier, he would have been old enough to figure in Pepys' Diary, and he might perhaps have been the object of one of the great naval administrator's typically incisive character sketches. But by the time Purcell was taking his first steps in composition in the 1670s, Pepys had already laid down his quill. Purcell kept no diary of his own - at least none has survived - and if he was active as a letter-writer, precious little of his correspondence has come down to us. Our evidence for the facts of the composer's life appears in a sequence of glimpses - a portrait here, an anecdote there, unvarnished entries in the official records of the time. We don't know for certain when or where he was born, or who his father was. We know he married a woman called Frances, who may have been the daughter of a Flemish leather merchant, but we can't be sure. We know that he had six children, four of whom died in infancy. We know that as a child he survived the Plague and the Great Fire of London, but we have no idea what took his life at the age of barely 36, or what other great masterpieces might have flowed from his pen had he survived to enjoy a more normal span of years.

Today the focus is on a single year, 1680, in which Purcell emerged as one of the greatest contrapuntists of his time.

1680 was a year of firsts for Purcell - he wrote his first music for stage, fulfilled his first commission for a royal 'welcome' ode, took his first (and only) wife, and made his first foray into the world of chamber music, with a sequence of nine fantazias of such dazzling contrapuntal ingenuity and brilliance - not to mention expressive maturity - that you have to marvel at how a composer of just 20 could have possibly pulled off such a dazzling feat.

Today, pieces he wrote to mark specific events, from King Charles' escape from shipwreck to the passing of Queen Mary.

Given that so little is known about Purcell's life, it's gratifying that a fair number of his compositions can be pinned to particular occasions. Many of these were commissions, like the two Cecilian Odes he wrote for The Musical Society in 1683 and 1692, or the sequence of royal 'welcome' odes that began in 1680 with 'Welcome, vicegerent of the mighty king' and ended with 'Who can from joy refrain', Purcell's ode celebrating the sixth birthday of Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, which he wrote in 1695, the year before his death. 'They that go down to the sea in ships' was written after the event it commemorates - the narrow escape of the king and his yachting party when a nasty storm blew up around the North Foreland off the Isle of Thanet; having narrowly survived its maiden voyage, the king's new yacht, 'Fubbs', remained in service for the best part of a century. Occasional music can easily lapse into obscurity after the occasion it was designed for is over - a fate that certainly hasn't befallen the music Purcell provided for the funeral of Queen Mary, whose stark grandeur achieves a kind of universal expression of grief. Grief runs through Purcell's early Funeral Sentences, which were probably written when he was still a chorister at the Chapel Royal. It's not known whose death they commemorate - perhaps that of one of his musical mentors.

Presented by Fiona Talkington

Founded in 1989, Concerto K”ln has become one of the world's most exciting and dynamic early music ensembles. In this programme, recorded in April in the glorious acoustic of Amsterdam's Royal Concertgebouw, its players contrast a concise yet dazzling concerto written by Vivaldi for the orphan girls of Venice's Ospedale della Pieta with the fifth of Bach's inventive \\"Brandenburg\\" concertos with solo parts for harpsichord, violin and flute.

Vivaldi:  Concerto for Strings in A, RV.158
Bach:  Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D, BWV.1050
Evgeny Sviridov, violin  
Cordula Breuer, traverse flute  
Wiebke Weidanz, harpsichord

Landing at Glenuig, he makes his way inland to Loch Moidart and MacDonald country, walking the old coffin road, which was used for centuries by funeral parties, taking their dead to a sacred isle. On the track Paul meets a trials bike enthusiast and learns the secrets of a 'dabbing coat' before landing off the Green Isle where he rings a 1,100-year-old bell for the dead. 

Taking a boat north, Paul sails up Loch Shiel to Glenfinnan where Bonnie Prince Charlie officially began his rising to reclaim the throne for the Stuart dynasty. From a forgotten monument that commemorates this event, Paul heads back to the coast and Loch Ailort, where he learns how to knife fight before taking a trip across the loch to a deserted community on the roadless Ardnish peninsula.

She finds a nation caught between the demands of a hi-tech future and the pull of a traditional past, where people work long hours but struggle to find time for love and relationships. Birth rates are falling and the population is shrinking. What does the future hold for this resilient and innovative country?

Japan will host the next Olympic Games, but the country's most traditional sport is still stuck in the Dark Ages when it comes to equality. Sue trains with a female sumo wrestling team trying to bring change to this male-dominated sport. 

After a night in a robot hotel, Sue visits a family who live with robots, helping out with household tasks like homework and bedtime stories. Sue falls in love with Aibo, the robot dog.

Outside Tokyo, in the shadow of Mount Fuji, Sue takes part in Hell Camp, Japan's toughest business school. Here she sees how Japan's strict corporate culture has created some of the world's most successful companies, with its traditional values of hard work and discipline.

But this commitment to work comes at a cost. Back in the city Sue meets Rina, a beautiful twentysomething taking part in the latest craze: a solo-wedding. Young women, concerned that they will never marry, are paying to have all the trimmings of the special day - hair, make-up and a big dress - but with no husband. Professional photographs are uploaded to social media.

Kawaii, or cuteness, is big in Japan and Pop Idol is a cultural phenomenon - a huge industry of manufactured girl bands. Sue goes to a Pop Idol gig in downtown Tokyo and is surprised to find that the audience is made up of middle-aged men in suits.

Later, Sue leaves Tokyo in search of a different side of Japan. The landscape outside the city is a revelation - forests, mountains and islands. In the sacred Kii mountains of Wakayama Prefecture, she has a go at shinrin-yoku or forest bathing. The Japanese believe that spending quiet time among the trees is good for body and soul.

The Japanese are a nation of nature worshippers. Sue joins pilgrims at a Shinto festival celebrating the autumn leaves. At the base of a sacred waterfall, she meets a priest who tells her that Japanese culture is all about finding harmony with nature.
