<div class="message">So, the programme in question is the following: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bbzc6t/wimbledon-2018-day-12-part-2-ladies-final">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0...dies-final</a><br />
<br />
What I am trying to do is start downloading at 8793 seconds in and stop at 20040 seconds in.<br />
<br />
This was actually my second attempt at downloading this.<br />
<br />
When I first tried yesterday, I got about 40% of the way through before get_iplayer failed for the same reason and then automatically restarted at 0.0% (which is when I stopped it).<br />
<br />
I then left it until today and got about 80% of the way through.<br />
<br />
I'm kind of devastated now because the programme will be unavailable in 3 days and I have plans and a poor internet connection.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can get this download to resume where it was (at around 80% of the way through the command) rather than starting from 0% again?<br />
<br />
What has me really worried is that it went from hvfhd2 to dhfhd1 before it failed again and the last time it did that, it started from 0.0%</div>

<div class="message">Resuming works fine so long as the same streams can be accessed. Your system obviously can't manage it. Judging from your description, your connection is simply too poor. Download at lower quality and/or in smaller time segments. There will be a few seconds of overlap between segments, so you would need to do some minor editing if you want a single file.</div>

Right, fair enough, thanks.</div>

Can you explain how exactly this can be achieved? I went to the AWS site they have so many choices of products and services I can't seem to make head or tail of it.<br />
<br />
Any help provided is appreciated. Thanks!</div>
