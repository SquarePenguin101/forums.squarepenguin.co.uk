<div class="message">Hi people,<br />
<br />
It seems that lots of people are interested in generating these cache by webscraping (right term?) the caches and then using the beloved iplayer as before. I was wondering if we could concentrate the posts here and also share experience with how to do it <br />
<br />
I'm particular interested in radio feeds so would be will to write a python (then perl) scrapper. My only is issue is that I need the template for the radio.cache file. Can you help<br />
<br />
Another question results to changing the way the cache works. Instead of downloading the whole BBC iplayer listing, which worked really with the feeds and now is quite slow via other methods. Would it be easier to use the pvr search terms with the iplayer search page (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=Doctor%who">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/search?q=Doctor%who</a>) <br />
<br />
Thanks for all you work <br />
<br />

<div class="message">Hello,<br />
<br />
I think that I can help a little here. Firstly, I have made improvements to the "Refresh Cache" software so now it looks almost the same as before the changes. There are still some limitations, for example only 20 episodes of each show are cached so Bargain Hunt fans will be unhappy! ;) The information is mostly complete for each episode including the jpg image. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">There are still some occasional problems that need fixing, I am sorry to say.</span><br />

<br />
I guess that this only works with a Windows PC, but I did read that it can also work on other operating systems?? I have two files that I copy into the get_iplayer directory which is âC:\Program Files (x86)\get_iplayerâ (on this machine). I then remove the â.txtâ from the end of both files so that they are simply named âRefresh_Cache_V0_3.plâ and âRefresh_Cache_V0_3.pl.cmdâ. I will try to upload the two files with this message.<br />
<br />
I then double click the âRefresh_Cache_V0_3.pl.cmdâ file to open the command, which just starts running the Perl code (âRefresh_Cache_V0_3.pl.cmdâ). My computer then sits there for a very long time scraping all the Data from the BBC iPlayer website and storing the results on the hard-disk, this refreshes the cache that get i-player uses to store all the data from the iPlayer system.

I worry about the huge amounts of data that is unnecessarily downloaded just to make a simple list of episodes on the BBC iPlayer.

<br />
I will post the format of the Radio Cache soon...<br />

<div class="message">Hi There!<br />
<br />
Since "Scraping" the whole of the BBC iPlayer website takes so long and uses so much bandwidth, I have tried to upload a "tv.cache" file made here on my own computer. The "Refresh_Cache_V0_3" code still has some bad bugs!! So, it makes more sense to just copy and paste this file for now until a fix is released later today.<br />
<br />
The file should be renamed as "tv.cache" and copied &amp; pasted into the correct location which is "C:\Users\"my USERNAME"\.get_iplayer\" on this Windows PC. If you are not sure of the location then you can open a DOS prompt (command prompt) and type "set" then hit enter, then look for "USERPROFILE" and next to this will be the correct location for the "tv.cache" file on your machine (if you add the "\.getiplayer\" part). <br />
<br />
I don't know if any of this is clear or explained properly, I am not a computer guy! LOL!!<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone!<br />
<br />

<div class="message">I'm getting close under Debian. I put new tv.cache file given above into /home/zippy/.get_iplayer<br />

This is really great all the work that you are all doing! I do not know if I have enough time, but I did take a look already at making the "Refresh Cache" Perl script to update both the "tv.cache" file and also the "radio.cache" file. The biggest problem is the huge number of episodes available on the iPlayer Radio system!!<br />

I can appreciate that Tiiveni, but that update only really needs to be run once a week to catch everything. Although some people might want it every 3 days to amke sure nothing they are collecting is missed!<br />

Sadly I am more of a hardware and network person than a coder otherwise I would have a crack, I can follow the logic but I wouldn't know how to start a new thread.<br />

Here is a "radio.cache" file that I have made here on my PC. It is incomplete as there are no "episodes" from Radio Series, only the radio programs that don't belong to a series. <br />

The new version of get iPlayer is out now, so I hope that this "radio.cache" file will not be needed. Fingers crossed!<br />
