<div class="message">Hi there.  Windows user here.  Get-Iplayer looked broken last night so like any sensible user I googled "get_iplayer broke" and found this thread.  Although I have some linux experience I don't pretend to understand most of what was said, but when the thread got to page 3 and "seems to be fixed", followed by "Solved" added to the thread title, I tried another test, only to find nothing had changed. <br />
<br />
However I then did a complete uninstall, including all preferences and user settings, and reinstalled from the old "latest" exe still sitting in my downloads.  <br />
<br />
All working again now.  Can someone explain to a poor noob exactly what has been fixed (BBC put their data feed back?) and why a complete reinstall resolved it for me?</div>

<div class="message"><blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite><span> (15-02-2016, 04:12 PM)</span></cite>Can someone explain to a poor noob exactly what has been fixed (BBC put their data feed back?)</blockquote>Some of the resources get_iplayer uses to get download and schedule information were blocked yesterday which meant that when get_iplayer either tried to refresh the programme cache or download any programme, it couldn't get the data it needs resulting in the errors we saw.<br />
<br />
Today they have restored these resources (at least for the time being) so get_iplayer now works again.<br />

Not sure of the answer to that one.</div>

<div class="message">I have been using iPlayer, very gratefully, since 2011. I panicked 48 hours ago when suddenly nothing worked. But due to this forum I was able to get up and running again. Thanks everyone. <br />
<br />
I also copied the 2.95 files and am amazed by the difference. First, the download speed is incredible. I have a 100Mbps asynchronous connection which is normally a measured 94Mbps down and 94Mbps up. It would previously take 10-15 minutes to download a 1-hour show in HD (approx 1GB). Now it takes just 2mins. Incredible.<br />
<br />
One puzzle, I think has been mentioned before. As I said, I am after HD, so I am downloading with --modes=best. After download is complete, during the conversion from an mp4 transport stream to mp4, I am getting a red error message "non-existing SPS 0 referenced in buffering period". However the resulting files seem perfect. What does the error warning message mean? Any comments on this?</div>

<div class="message">@spurfilm, I noticed that error with 2.95 as well but it doesn't seem to be affecting the final mp4 (I use mode=best also). It was reported as an FYI by errfmt back on the 12th January in Windows Forums › Windows Troubleshooting. Checking the Google and it seems to be a common streaming error across a range of devices and apps. A fatal but fixable error with some apps depending on the commands used. However, I have yet to see an actual explanation of the fault or what causes it and I can't be bothered to go looking through various streaming specs to find what could be the cause, at least as long as it has no actual effect on the output mp4.</div>

OK, that's reassuring. Many thanks.</div>

<div class="message">Hi there.<br />
<br />
I notice on V2.94 (old) that I can't download radio --tried BBC 3 Choral evensong  --pid=b0705754 --type=radio  (Wed feb 17 approx. 18.00 UK time).<br />
<br />
Worked fine on V2.95 (development)<br />
<br />
Tried to get program at UK time around 18.00 when it was available on standard BBC Iplayer radio<br />
<br />
Got two computers - one with old version, other with new -- both running W10 pro x-64. Latest W10 updates applied.<br />
<br />
<a href="static/thread-658-aid163.png"><img src="static/thread-658-aid163.png"/></a><br />
<br />
update -- at 18.20 UK time seems the old V2.94 is now working again -- not sure what the Beeb are doing currently !!!!.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers</div>

<div class="message">Hi there<br />
V2.94 now working -- seems I might have just got in when BBC were making program available on Iplayer --probably best to wait for a couple of hours after scheduled broadcast time.<br />
<br />
