@user-1141 - unless you can directly access a file containing the audio stream the only route is realtime recording :( You might be able to find software that enables "WhatYouHear" on your soundcard though which avoids having to physically plug in cables but will pick up any noises played through the soundcard.</div>

<div class="message">That was a pleasant surprise. Having a spare machine to play around with so I didn't have  to bother with backing up my main installation, I overwrote get_iplayer.pl and .cgi with the v2.95 ones from the development branch, ran it, entered the necessary command line and copying/pasting the complete url from the programmes iPlayer play page and hey presto, not only did it download the item, but it downloaded at my fibre connection's maximum speed instead of the 1.2 MBps I usually get with any get_iplayer TV download. Well unless flvstreamer.exe throws a wobbly with an error message that it has failed and falls over after starting a download, when the download speed often doubles to 2.4 MBps after closing the error message.</div>

<div class="message">Good to know that there is a fairly simple fix to this, provided one is confident at editing configuration files. I can find the v2.95 .cgi file, but at am a loss as to where I can locate the relevant get_iplayer.pl file.<br />
<br />
Seems strange that your download speed previously was so slow, as I have been experiencing download speeds of around 12 MBps or greater on my fibre connection on my Linux machine.</div>

<div class="message">It's the get_iplayer file without an extension and about 432KB (443,249 in the zip folder) in size. Just add the .pl extension, replace the get_iplayer.pl and the get_iplayer.cfg in your get_iplayer folder with the renamed file get_iplayer file and the get_iplayer.cfg from the development version and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
As to the speed, never used get_player on Linux but previously on all my Windows laptops, whether XP, Win 7, Win 8.1 or a Surface Pro 2 with 8.1, I have always had 1.2 MBps when on ADSL1 (7.2 Mbps line), ADSL2+ (15 Mbps line) or when I moved to fibre (80 Mbps) and only since I copied over the two v2.95 files have I had the full speed of my fibre during a download. Go figure :)</div>

<br />
Obviously your paths will be different.<br />
<br />
Note, this is running the command line in the get_iplayer folder.<br />
<br />
I should have added that I enter the get_iplayer folder using the get_iplayer shortcut that the Window install adds to ones systems with the command:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k get_iplayer.cmd --search dontshowanymatches &amp;&amp; get_iplayer.cmd --help<br />
<br />
Though it works just as well if I use just the first command line above and entering the get_iplayer folder manually or via Explorer and selecting open command window here from the right click context menu.</div>

<div class="message">There is a new way to hack radio downloads using the<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">HLS </span>links as made available at beebotron here<br />
<a href="https://beebotron.org/listings/radio4fm/hls/">https://beebotron.org/listings/radio4fm/hls/</a><br />
<br />
Note the program pid is in each url<br />
e.g <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">b0705cgr </span>in the following url<br />
http:// open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/5/redir/version/2.0/vpid/<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">b0705cgr</span>/mediaset/audio-syndication/proto/http<br />
<br />
If you download the link you get a text <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">m3u8 </span>file.<br />
that file contains another link - this time to an text m3u8 <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">index </span>file.<br />
That file contains urls to <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">segments </span>of mp4 files<br />
Each segment's url is on a seperate line and is nicely numbered in time order.<br />
These can be downloaded individually in parallel - using say <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">wget</span>.<br />
My segments were 10s in length.<br />
Once all the segments are downloaded - say into a dedicated folder then you can join them all back up again into a single mp4 using say <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">MP4joiner </span>from here: <a href="http://www.mp4joiner.org/en/">http://www.mp4joiner.org/en/</a><br />
<br />
Now you can convert mp4 into mp3 using the usual manner.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that this is the way forward - only that it might be.</div>

LOL, an error I have done before now.<br />
<br />
Quote does work, only it doesn't show in the enter text box immediately, but if you look under the text box you will see the words below along with two links;<br />
<br />
You have selected one or more posts to quote. Quote these posts now or deselect them.<br />

Click on 'Quote these posts now' and anything you have clicked the quote button on will appear in the text entry box. It caught me out at first :)</div>

Go to git hub download page for get_iplayer and look for the button at the top labelled 2 branches and click on it and you will see two entries one of which is the Active development version. Click on develop.<br />
<br />
Or go directly to the development download page using the link below;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/tree/develop">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/tree/develop</a><br />
<br />
and then download the zip file (button near the top right of the list). <br />
<br />
Open the zip file and drag out the get_iplayer and get_iplayer.cfg file. Rename get_iplayer to get_iplayer.pl. <br />
<br />
Then after creating a backup of your get-iplayer folder just in case. replace the get_iplayer.pl and get_iplayer.cfg with the ones you got from the zip file and you are good to go.<br />
<br />

If the beeb have made permanent changes that break the way get_iplayer now grabs program data, then I imagine so. The beeb did the same a short while ago but that time they reverted in less than a day IIRC so no changes were needed to get_iplayer.</div>

<div class="message">Hi there<br />
I suspect it's currently broken because of the new BBC store where people will be able to purchase shows etc from the Beeb's Library.  I hope though for stuff available (Free) via normal BBC I_player the get_iplayer application can be mended or someone posts an easy get around. Currently it seems you need for Radio to go back to old fashioned "Real Time recording" and for TV use a Video recorder to record the show to a DVD and rip it with MakeMKV   --unfortunately if you do this you'll end up with only DVD rip quality as I don't think there are any HD DVD recorders available - and using that type of process is going backwards !!!.<br />
<br />
Another route would be if there was a way to De-DRM the standard downloads --anybody yet !!!<br />
<br />
Hopefully the get_iplayer app will be fixed.<br />
<br />
Note the fix above doesn't apply to WINDOWS systems.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div>
