<div class="message">Hey all, new to this but seem to have sussed how to "record" from iplayer but one show in particular I am struggling finding on fet_iplayer web pvr. Have literally gone through the list and cant find it, have tried searching for the episode name and the show name but still no finds. I went ahead and updated the cache also with no luck<br />
<br />
Have checked on iplayer and the show in question is available to 17:00 05 November 2018 and also played the show on iplayer to ensure it was working.<br />
<br />
I am at a bit of a dead end currently not sure what I am doing wrong as I have been able to grab other shows just fine and find them just fine</div>

<div class="message">Sorry but my mind reading skills are not working too well since I had to return my time machine ;-)<br />
<br />
How about telling us the name and episode number of the programme and perhaps the URL on BBC iPlayer?</div>

Ahhhhh yes that would help. Chucklevision and with regards to episode number - any of Season 8 (this is the only season that is available) <br />
<br />
Im thinking I have done something wrong as all im seeing is the likes of bbc 1, bbc 2 not the internet only channel like bbc 3</div>

<div class="message">You say Season 8 is available, not according to what I'm looking at... unless I'm looking in the wrong place... but then you didn't give me a URL, as I requested.<br />
<br />
Searching on "Chucklevision" within the BBC iPlayer, I ended up at the following URL:<br />
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/chucklevision#episodes">https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/chucklevision#episodes</a><br />
<br />
According to this there appear to be six episodes currently available from Season 21.<br />
<br />
If you right click on each episode in turn, you can save the URL. So, for example, "Cops and Robbers" is at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/cbbc/episode/b00phvly">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/cbbc/episode/b00phvly</a>.<br />
<br />
I don't use the pvr but if you open a command prompt and type:<br />
get_iplayer --PID <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/cbbc/episode/b00phvly">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/cbbc/episode/b00phvly</a><br />
or even:<br />
get_iplayer --PID b00phvly<br />
you should see the download taking place. Repeat this process for each programme.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that internet only programmes can only be downloaded using the programme PID. I wouldn't have a clue how to do this using the PVR (If indeed you can) as I never use the PVR. I'm a command prompt sorta guy!<br />
<br />
If you can point me towards the Season 8 episodes then I'll have a look at those for you.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
<br />
Edit - sorry about the info..... if you click on "see more results" in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=ChuckleVision&amp;sa_f=search-product&amp;scope">https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=ChuckleVi...duct&amp;scope</a>= you will see further episodes.</div>

<br />
