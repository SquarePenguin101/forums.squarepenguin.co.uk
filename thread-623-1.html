So it seems, yes, they are changing structure again - probably with tighter individual controls.<br />
<br />
Downloading by PID still works, but it means that search functions are screwed.</div>

<div class="message">Get iPlayer will try each of these feeds 3 times so you only need to worry if all 3 attempts fail which has not happened on your cache refresh so the cache has probably still been successfully refreshed.<br />
<br />
Visiting some of those URLs in the browser sometimes results in the downtime message but refreshing the page a few times seems to get the programme data up and then another refresh might take you back to the downtime message so it seems a bit hit and miss.</div>

<div class="message">I've been using the --pid-recursive option recently with 2.94 which now appears to fail for the same reason.  I used --pid-recursive to download any new available episodes for a particular series without having to find all of the individual episode pids.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that the information I need must be available from the iplayer website and it ought to be possible to use python/curl to assemble the episode pids and make an individual get_iplayer call for each one.  Has anyone else tried anything similar or got any scripts that they'd like to share?</div>

<div class="message">I'm receiving the "ERROR: Failed to get version pid metadata from iplayer site" message too. I've been trying to download an episode of Eggheads for the past half hour; tried both removing all saved user or preset options and reinstalling get_iplayer to no avail. I thought it may have been a problem with just that particular iPlayer episode but attempting to download the following day's episode presented me with the same problem.<br />
<br />
I'm not a tech expert so I hope you may be able to find a way to fix this as get_iplayer has been a very reliable and useful program for me. :)<br />

EDIT: I usually download via PID but I tried downloading via URL which didn't work either.</div>

<div class="message">I can confirm snowballing metadata failures.<br />
<br />
As a datapoint, there has been an Ondemand series with Frank Skinner for the last month or so, that has not appeared in the metadata, and was downloadable via the pid.<br />
<br />
Using the pid has ceased working, although it appears the url was  "http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode" not "/programmes". Not sure if this is relevant.<br />
<br />
It is still playable inside the flash container on Linux within Firefox...<br />

<div class="message">Hello,<br />
<br />
I do not know if this helps with tonight's problems, but when similar things happened before, the community made an alternative method to update the cache files used by get_iPlayer. It seems that this alternative method is able to get the information from the BBC despite the changes, even today. This is like Déjà vu! But, at the moment, I am unsure if this really helps...<br />
<br />
<a href="thread-250.html">/threa...ml#pid1509</a><br />
<br />
I am looking into this tonight, just in case it can be useful. Be warned that at least 20 minutes is needed to download all of the TV programs from the iPlayer website!<br />
<br />
Many thanks, as always to the great people that help out with this software and the forum!<br />
<br />

<div class="message">It appears that the BBC has killed get_iplayer (again). They have removed all the data sources used by get_iplayer, not just the XML schedule data.  As you have seen, you can neither download directly via <kbd>--pid</kbd> nor refresh your TV programme cache to perform searches. The radio cache will refresh, but downloads fail. There is no workaround for these problems - changes to get_iplayer will be necessary to restore functionality. I will wait a day or two to see what else the BBC destroys, and then make some kind of patched release over the weekend.</div>
