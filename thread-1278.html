<div class="message">Please see attachments. When I paste the code in here the post turns into a HTML nightmare<br />
<br />
Using iMac running El Capitan<br />
<br />
Pasted code in screenshot_1431 into terminal. All went well then had screenshot_1432<br />
<br />
Thought I would ask before proceeding. Trying to download using PID numbers from GiA.<br />
<br />
Many thanks

<div class="message">I've changed the topic. There is no way to install GiA via Homebrew.<br />
<br />
Use a bit of common sense and read what brew is telling you, as SP pointed out. It is literally giving you the command necessary to fix your broken <kbd>lame</kbd> library installation (no need to uninstall anything first). Do that and then run <kbd>brew install ffmpeg</kbd> until it installs without error, then go back and install get_iplayer</div>

Thank you Squarepenguin.<br />

I think I am trying to install get_iplayer. I have had the Automator on my machine for years and have been very glad of it but apparently (I learned tonight) the BBC have now blocked it. I discovered this when I was reading the post on Github trying to assess why it wasn't working. Someone had written that Homebrew must be installed (they gave a link which I followed and completed) then there was another link for get_iplayer which is why I ended up here. Sorry for my lack of knowledge on this. I am now starting to understand why what I was using had the Automator on the end. Apparently I am able to gain the PID number using it and then get_iplayer via terminal.<br />
<br />
How would I go about uninstalling the packages you mentioned above? I am not very knowledgeable on the terminal but do know some commands but only the most basic.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for getting back to me it is greatly appreciated<br />

<div class="message">Dinky's jumped in with some instructions above so have a read of that comment. <br />
<br />
I remember one time I installed from Homebrew I had the same error as you and undertook the same remedy as Dinky mentions above, but <kbd>brew</kbd> wasn't able to sort the error without first uninstalling <kbd>lame</kbd> first and then reinstalling - for what reason I don't know as it shouldn't have made any difference as far as I can tell. But, there you go.<br />
<br />
In your case, simply follow the instructions in Dinky's post and hopefully you'll be sorted.</div>

I did see the notes in terminal about what was happening but whenever I tried to do what it suggested it reported back that I wasn't able to do that. I did eventually try to remove lame but again I was unable to do it due to permissions even though I thought I'd over-ridden them.<br />
<br />
I have copied below what I have had from Terminal (I re-ran the actions it in sequence to get it in a tidy format) in case it is of any use.<br />
<br />
I understand from the heading at the top of the page that there are problems with get_iplayer anyway at the moment. <br />
<br />
Thank you all very much for the work over the years. It has been a great pleasure to have been able to access the the iPlayer in this way and it has been a source of great pleasure I wouldn't have been able to have had if it hadn't been for your efforts. Thanks again and my best wishes for your success with this latest hurdle.<br />

<div class="message">Can't help you there, I'm afraid. It would seem you didn't install Homebrew correctly and the permissions under /usr/local weren't set properly. Stuff shouldn't be owned by root unless you installed things into /usr/local as root before you installed Homebrew. You have to be careful about that. I don't think you would even be able to run brew as root, so no clue what you've done to your permissions. I can only suggest you completely uninstall Homebrew and start over from the beginning. Uninstall script is noted in their FAQ:<br />
