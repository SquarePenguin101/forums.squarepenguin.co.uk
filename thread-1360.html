<div class="message">I've experienced a strange problem in v3.00. It appeared to be caused by a combination of 1) episodes not appearing in cache AND 2) the use of --pid-recursive.  I've resolved my own problem and I'm not sure anything is to be done but thought I'd describe the issue here in case it's deemed a bug or in case anyone else runs into similar. <br />
<br />
Firstly I only have 2 out of 4 available episodes of "Rhod Gilbert's Work Experience" appearing in my listings cache. All four are available on iplayer website and all four are able to be downloaded via direct URL/PID using older v2.97. (Note I've clean installed v3.00 under a separate user account for testing so that my preferences/cache between versions are kept separated.) <br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not normally bothered about the cache as I always just use URLS or PIDS after browsing the iplayer website. But in v3.00 I could only download the two episodes that already appeared in the listings cache. Attempts to download the other two episodes (not in the cache) via URL/PID method threw up a "Failed to fetch episode PID" error. I did try adding the --future option per 'known problems' but no difference. <br />

I don't know why the cache problem but eventually I tracked the downloading problem down to my having <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">--pid-recursive</span> in my preferences file. <br />
<br />
I know --pid-recursive doesn't make sense when you want to manually download a non-series PID but I've always had it in my preferences file as previously (at least in v2.97) it always appeared to be ignored for non-series PIDs and was safe to leave there for some lazy occasions when I did want to use a series-based PID. (Mainly because I also used --pid-recursive-noclips as well and together they were quite long to have to remember). <br />
<br />
Once removed from my preferences file, the missing non-cached 2 episodes downloaded successfully via URL/PID method in v3.00. Of course they still don't appear in my listings cache for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
Purely for testing purposes, if I manually added --pid-recursive back to the CLI command for downloading the correctly cached pids, then the download is successful. But when the same is used for the 2 non-cached pids, the download isn't attempted. <br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Failure scenario:  NON-CACHED episode AND --pid-recursive option used</span><br />
(Doesn't make sense to do this but it might occur if --pid-recursive is in your preferences file)<br />

The URL in the error message at the bottom gives a good clue I think. I guess this behaviour must have had to change due to the re-implementation and the way web-scraping works? <br />
<br />
The solution is obviously just not to use it in my saved preferences. <br />
<br />
If the maintainer wants to see more I will gather some logs etc. I'm not sure it's worth worrying about though - just to be aware of.</div>
