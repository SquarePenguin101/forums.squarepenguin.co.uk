<div class="message">I have been using Get_iplayer on Windows (Win 7 64) for several years and today accidently uninstalled it (ver 2.83) when trying to uninstall the VLC component. I reinstalled it (ver2.85) using the latest installer including all components except VLC.<br />
<br />
However, it is now not working. Trying to record radio and TV fails (see attached log). The uninstall did not remove my settings or history and the only setting I changed following the install was to add a VLC path by --prefs-add --VLC="etc. (See log)<br />
<br />
I was a PVR user, and most of the settings were set up using that, but by following the e-mails for several years I have now learnt to use the command line for most things (although still use the web interface too).<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I should do - or try uninstalling it all, deleting my prefs etc. Is there a separate preferences file from the user based one?<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated.<br/><br/>

<div class="message">The output you attached doesn't provide good test cases.  For Heidi, get_iplayer is telling you that you already downloaded it:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>Already Completed at: 5760.035 sec Duration=5.760 sec</blockquote>
<br />
If you delete the previous output file, re-download with <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>--force</code></div></div> in your command line.  The above message indicates the file still exists.<br />
<br />
For Newsround, you are trying to download an episode that is no longer available from iPlayer, as the get_iplayer output indicates:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>WARNING: No programmes are available for this pid with version(s): default</blockquote>
<br />
Daily news programmes generally disappear after 24 hours.<br />
<br />
If you do more testing, find a programme that you've never downloaded, verify it is available on the iPlayer site, then download it with the <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>--verbose</code></div></div> option in your command line to capture all available output.</div>

<div class="message">To answer your other question: yes, there is a system preferences file separate from user prefs.  However, you should never touch that file - it is managed by the installer.  Your output doesn't indicate any problems with preferences.</div>

<div class="message">Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
The Heidi radio programme hadn't been downloaded before - but I tried a new programme that I knew had not and that returned the same error. I then found another new programme and ran it with --force and that also failed in the same way. A verbose log is attached.<br />
<br />
The found the Newsround in the get_iplayer index as selected it as it would be short - however, running it again on a regular programme it worked. So sorry about that.<br />
<br />
The radio is where there is an issue still.<br/><br/>

<div class="message">You have a trailing unmatched quote in the value for <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>outputradio</code></div></div>.  I think that is messing up the construction of the output file path.  Remove it and try again.</div>

<div class="message">Thank you, thank you, thank you. That has fixed it.<br />
<br />
I cleared the prefs and it worked. I have then have added them back in correctly (checking the wiki carefully for syntax) and it still works.<br />
<br />
I have tried to say this before through the old email lists but I could never work out how to get my contribution accepted, but I really appreciate all you've done on this project. I'm a secondary school teacher and having a library of clips is sooo useful. I came to this project after Po_Ru's programme stopped working. I signed up to the list and looked at many emails in wonder and their technical content. Slowly though I started to understand some simpler things and migrated from the Web interface to the command line. Seeing similar questions helped me learn and also inspired me and so I bought a Pi and thought I'd learn some of this (I was a Spectrum BASIC generation user).<br />
<br />
So thank you for what you've done on the project (and the other regular contributors) - it really is a huge amount of work you've done, but thank you also for inspiring me to learn.</div>
