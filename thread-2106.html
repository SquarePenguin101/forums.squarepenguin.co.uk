<div class="message">Three problems: First, as you can see from your saved search, you are setting up a pvr search for the string "category = Quiz", which get_iplayer is doing faithfully, but of course no results are returned - that will never appear in a programme name. Second, your manual search is not the same since that is searching for any of the three strings "category", "=", or "Quiz". Third, this implies you think get_iplayer can somehow search by category, but it hasn't been able to do that for years.</div>

YES.<br />
To reverse answer your comments.<br />
 As I said at the top I have been using this for a long time. I was unaware that the search by category had been removed, since get-iplayer is automatically updated, and I don't see change logs.<br />
<br />
As to Quiz never appearing in a name, "The Food Quiz", "The News Quiz" both have it in their names.<br />
<br />
The manual search was for the exact same string I entered into the pvr search. I know since I cut &amp; pasted it.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK so figured out how to convert my category searches to name searches.</div>

<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite><span> (03-10-2019, 12:07 PM)</span></cite>So how do I now setup a new pvr that will do the same as it used to?</blockquote>The pvr search you are attempting would never have produced results in any version of get_iplayer, and I've already said that you cannot search by category, so you'll have to explain what "as it used to" means.</div>

<div class="message"><blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>get-iplayer is automatically updated, and I don't see change logs</blockquote>
to be fair, the change logs are there, you just don't read them.  like probably 100% of us.  dp publishes release notes for every release, here: <a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/releasenotes">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplay...leasenotes</a><br />
<br />
just to clarify:<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>&#36; get_iplayer --pvr-add=quiz "category = Quiz"</code></div></div>saves a search that is equivalent to<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>&#36; get_iplayer "category = Quiz"</code></div></div>which searches for the exact string "category = Quiz" in the name.<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>&#36; get_iplayer category = Quiz</code></div></div>does something very different - it searches for programmes with either "category" or "=" or "Quiz" in the name.<br />
<br />
which is why one finds programmes and one doesn't.<br />
<br />
you asked<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>So how do I now setup a new pvr that will do the same as it used to?</blockquote>
<br />
the nearest you can get is<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>&#36; get_iplayer quiz</code></div></div>which will find any programme with "quiz" in the name.  This isn't a category search because (as dp notes) get_iplayer can't do this any more (the BBC took the data away).<br />
<br />
and to save this as a pvr search:<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>&#36; get_iplayer --pvr-add=quiz quiz</code></div></div><br />
