<div class="message">What I was asking<br />
<br />
, probably didn't explain very well. I'm using the get iplayer program, I have told it what series I want to record..on the the record tab I think it calls it pvr recordings, I want to delete some episodes, that it has already recorded, it says u can delete anything u have already recorded, well I do the tick box and then click delete tab, but it comes back and says it has not deleted Those programs......this list is just going to get bigger if I can't delete old episodes of radio shows....hope u can can help, getting confused...</div>

<div class="message">Do the old downloads actually exist on disk, in the original locations to which they were downloaded?  You will get "no files deleted" messages if the files have been moved or have already been deleted.</div>

<div class="message">That doesn't make sense. Merely moving files around on your computer doesn't delete them from the system, so there is something you left out. It doesn't matter, though. Not to belabour the obvious, but if you don't move the files after download you can delete them in the Web PVR Manager just like any other user. If you want to use a different output directory for your recordings so you don't have to move them yourself, that is covered in the Help page.<br />
<br />
Normally, an entry in the recording history without a file would appear dimmed, but it looks like that was broken in the last release. You can still tell if the associated file was deleted or moved because the Actions column will be empty.</div>
