<div class="message">All seems to be working on my windows machines with the new dev code. Thanks Dinky for your speedy response.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell the dev version (2.95-dev) is working fine, so I think I'll leave it in place for now.</div>

If you run into a problem with one of them, you will be on your own. If you wish to keep using the dev version, I strongly suggest waiting until at least Monday (to make sure something else doesn't blow up), then downloading to the latest dev code, which removes the patch implemented yesterday. I'll try to implement a better patch over the weekend. With yesterday's patch, some tag metadata will be missing and some audiodescribed/signed programmes will be unavailable, and there could be other glitches. In retrospect it would have been better to wait, but I guess it wouldn't be get_iplayer without a semi-annual panic.</div>

I've done what you've done aeboyles &amp; I've left things at the mo &amp; I've not reverted back to ver 2.94 but then realised after I've downloaded some programmes that I only want in SD that they are in HD. I do remember now that Dinky had said that using the patch would mean all programmes will download in HD.</div>

It wouldn't be the first time. And you do have to wonder if the reprieve is only temporary.  When I saw that all the programme metadata had disappeared as well as the schedule data, I assumed it was another BBC data bonfire. More fool me.</div>

Thank you for putting the temporary patch in place as quickly as you did. Lets hope they don't do that again too quickly.<br />

Probably other things broke so they reversed the closedown for now. Or maybe it was genuine maintenance... Odd time of day to do it though if it was.</div>

<div class="message">It is worth pointing out that the screen scraping, and metadata provide different sets of data. Perhaps there is more going on at the BBC?<br />

I considered implementing a "just enough" patch to 2.94, but <a href="https://youtu.be/CYLSi9cdWys">it's too late to turn back now</a>.</div>

I do apologize.  I used the url with a 'copy' from the Iplayer site, which gave me<br />
'Episode <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06wj6zt/dickensian-episode-9">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06...-episode-9</a>'<br />
not<br />
'http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06wj6zt/dickensian-episode-9'<br />
When I cut out the crap it worked.</div>

Hi Senior Geek &amp; tvfan,<br />
I always use the URL &amp; I'll copy what I used here:-<br />
<br />
get_iplayer --url <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06wj6zt/dickensian-episode-9">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06...-episode-9</a> --tvmode=best<br />
<br />
and my download finished at 22:45pm &amp; these are the details:-<br />
<br />
Dickensian_-_9._Episode_9_b06wj6zt_default.mp4<br />
14/01/2016 22:45 510,351KB 00:28:58<br />
<br />
I haven't watched the whole programme but what I do to check it's working OK I play about 20secs of the beginning &amp; the very end &amp; in both cases it plays as it should. Be aware that I have the HD download which is what I want.<br />
Thanks.</div>
