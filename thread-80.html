Any advice on how to overcome my problem is greatly appreciated and I will persevere and thoroughly read the help pages but meantime because of my urgency if any one could record this and send to me I am willing to pay for their trouble.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div>

<div class="message">Relax. You said you have 3 days. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the error message you included suggests you do not have RTMPdump installed. This might point to a failed installation of get_iplayer and it's dependencies. <br />
<br />
I would recommend that you uninstall your current version of get_iplayer and reinstall it and ALL the various dependencies (additional programmes) that are required. You can find the installer on the download page here:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://squarepenguin.co.uk/guides/windows-quick-install-guide/">https://squarepenguin.co.uk/guides/windo...all-guide/</a><br />
<br />
The installer will automatically install all the required additional programmes. Do NOT untick any of those additional programmes during the install process, even if you have something like VLC installed already.<br />
<br />
If this error continues after a clean reinstall then there could be something interfering with RTMPdump and we can begin to investigate that.</div>

<div class="message">Many thanks for your prompt response. The panic is off :)<br />
<br />
Before I got your mail I read on here about someones similar issue with the RTMPdump and thought I would try the same thing that worked for him, which I did. Before I read your advice to include all the dependencies tho I had begun the install and only ticked for the install and the dump. Pleased to say tho that I have an almost perfect copy of my vid which hopefully I will have for posterity so it has turned out good for me as is.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div>
