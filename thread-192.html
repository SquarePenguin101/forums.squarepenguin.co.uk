<div class="message">Hi guys<br />
<br />
I have been using this great tool for a while, even just last week, but this weekend it stopped fetching new programmes anymore. The refresh doesnt come up with any feeds. I figure it might be like the last post on this matter, that BBC's own iplayer is down, but is it? I tried reinstalling the latest version, it made things worse as now the perl.exe doesn't work. Not sure if this is related.<br />
<br />
Anyone else facing a problem with the service?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="message">Are you using Win or something else?<br />
<br />
Can you please post what you type when using get_player and what response you get.<br />
<br />
Also, please copy that screen to your reply. It may be that you are in a region that has a problem with BBC IPlayer (which has happened more frequently in recent weeks).<br />
<br />
I appreciate this is of little help - but it is at least a start!</div>

<div class="message">Tks for reply. Sorry m new to this forum, here is my detls:<br />
<br />
os: vista home basic<br />
browser: firefox<br />
version pvr: latest<br />
location: malaysia<br />
<br />
Well, yesterday I reinstalled the latest version from this blog, and i had a perl.exe error. But today when I launched pvr, the problem seems to have gone away and now I can run the programmes browser, except nothing comes out (which takes me back to the situation I had before I reinsatlled. As you can see from screen caps, the results I got last week when things worked fine, are still there. But when I refresh, it fetches no new programmes. Earlier when I refreshed it did fetch some results, but nothing from Radio 3.<br />
<br />
I primarily use this for Radio 3 classical programmes. perhaps its iplayer is down too?<br />
<br />
Can you download Radio 3 programmes from where you are?<br />
<br />
i have six attachment so I send in two batches. They are screencap of the pvr window, and the browser<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<div class="message">Since you are trying to access iPlayer from outside the UK, we can't help you, so I'm going to close this thread.  However, here are a few general suggestions: <br />
<br />
1. Your browser screen shot suggests that you do not have the latest version, or else your cache hasn't been updated for nearly 5 months.  If it doesn't say version 2.86 at the bottom of the web pvr screen, then you don't have the latest version<br />
<br />
2. Stop using the web pvr to debug your problem.  It only obfuscates what may be going on and is useless for debugging.  Open the get_iplayer console window and attempt to refresh the cache with the following command:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer --type tv,radio --refresh --verbose</code></div></div><br />
Assuming it runs, look for error messages in the rather voluminous output.<br />
<br />
3. Your problem with invoking perl.exe indicates something is wrong with your system - a bad/missing/misinstalled DLL or something like that.  Nobody else will know what you've done to your system, so it will be impossible to even guess.  All I can suggest is that if you've installed a non-get_iplayer version of Perl at any time, remove it completely and do a complete uninstall/re-install of get_iplayer.  And make sure you install get_iplayer while logged in as a user who is a member of the Adminstrators group.</div>
