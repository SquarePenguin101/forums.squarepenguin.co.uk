<div class="message">Long time user of Get_iplayer, but I'm having issues downloading embedded news clips. <br />
<br />
I've done it in the past, but for the life of me, I can't remember how or has the beeb has changed something...<br />
<br />
I'm on Win 7 and using version 2.83. Works fine for iplayer programmes, but won't play ball with embedded clips, I've tried a few with the following command (I use command line exclusively):<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files (x86)\get_iplayer&gt;get_iplayer <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23434851">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23434851</a> --tvmode=flashvhigh --nopurge<br />

<div class="message">That page was in a new format that get_iplayer didn't understand.  get_iplayer has been patched to grok the new format.  To use a patched get_iplayer, see the Git HEAD section of the <a href="https://squarepenguin.co.uk/wiki/installation/">Installation Guides</a>.  Try the same clip and reply here if it doesn't work.</div>

<div class="message">Apologies for double posting, I went and had a look at at the github and saw that you had created a get_iplayer for Detect playlist URL in JSON for embedded clips and tried using that to replace my current get_iplayer.pl. Still nothing :/</div>

<div class="message">It looks like there is now a different problem with embedded clips, but that problem occurs only on Windows.  No prospect of a fix on the horizon - it will take a while to get to the bottom of this.  If you have access to a Mac or Linux machine, you can use the patched get_iplayer there to download your clip.<br />
<br />
As a test, on your Windows machine please try to download this clip:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21776497">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21776497</a><br />
<br />
It has the old format, and I'd like to know if a page with the old format behaves differently for you.</div>

<div class="message">Hi there, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help! I'm sorry but the link you posted doesn't work for me either. <br />
<br />
Would I be able to use get_iplayer on linux I run from a flash drive? I have to keep windows on my laptop for work. <br />
<br />
I shall be patient and hope that you can get to the bottom of it at some point.<br />
<br />
Note: rtmpexplorer will download it, but it tells me it's crashed even though it's downloading it and it downloads only the lowest quality version. Boo.</div>

<div class="message">At least we're getting the same results. rtmpexplorer uses a different method to find the stream, so not really equivalent in this situation.  For some reason, get_iplayer on Windows isn't receiving the full contents of the page containing the clip, so parsing for resource URLs fails.<br />
<br />
I think you should be able to run get_iplayer on a flash drive Linux.  This problem only affects embedded clips, so wouldn't have to fire up Linux all the time.</div>

<div class="message">This turns out to a problem with the bundled version of Perl rather than get_iplayer itself.  It will be necessary to create a new installer to fully fix the problem.  If embedded clips are important to you, as a temporary measure you can download and run the previous incarnation of the installer:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win/get_iplayer_setup_4.5.exe">http://www.infradead.org/get_iplayer_win...up_4.5.exe</a><br />
<br />
Click No when asked to download the newer installer and accept any upgrades indicated.  You should see that the Perl support is actually being downgraded.  The only features you will be missing are related to secure email functions, and it is unlikely that you use those.<br />
<br />
After running the old installer, update get_iplayer.pl from Git as you did before.</div>

<div class="message">Super! Thanks user-2!! Works like a dream now. :)<br />
<br />
I did try it on linux last night and I could install get_iplayer and run it, but the download kept flaking out at 1.2%.</div>
