<div class="message">I have been trying to install the latest version of get_iplayer, Version 3.01.0 but I have been unable to. I was previously using Version 2.94 but was unable to download a recent programme from BBC iPlayer so I thought I would upgrade to see if that helped.<br />
<br />
In trying to install the latest version I removed 2.94 but can still not install 3.01, and now I can't even re-install 2.94 so at the moment I have nothing to use.<br />
<br />
The PID of the programme I was trying to download is p0559fd8 but I have no idea why it wouldn't work. Can anyone please help me get a working version of get_iplayer installed on my computer and possibly tell me why that programme will not download? By the way I am using Windows 10 Home 64-bit if that makes any difference.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div>

<br />
First of all I have managed to get version 2.94 working again so at least I have something to use.<br />
<br />
When trying to install the latest version I don't get any errors, it appears to complete the installation but afterwards nothing happens. When I launch get_iplayer from the start menu it runs the previously installed version (2.94) so it doesn't seem to be updating the files properly when installing.<br />
<br />
And when I run version 2.94 and try to download the programme I want I still get an error, I have attached a screenshot of the problem</div>

<div class="message">You gave no indication as to why you think you can't install v3.01.0. You only actually demonstrated that you couldn't invoke it from a menu shortcut installed with v2.94. The installer tries to clean up old versions, but there are reasons that might fail. It would be a mutual waste of time trying to figure out which one applies in this case. Support for v2.94 was dropped a year ago, and the BBC has rendered it useless in the interim. The first thing you need to do is eradicate it from your machine. Run the uninstaller, delete <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\get_player</kbd> (and wherever you installed v2.94, if different), then follow the cleanup instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer_win32/wiki/cleanup">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplay...ki/cleanup</a>. Also delete any get_iplayer shortcuts you created yourself.  Then run the v3.01.0 installer. If there is no <kbd>C:\Program Files (x86)\get_player</kbd> directory created by the installer, then there is something on your system (anti-virus?) preventing the installation.</div>

<br />
I did wonder if the problem with downloading was due to version 2.94. I will give uninstalling a go again and see what happens</div>

<div class="message">I am seeing exactly the same issue on my windows 10 64bit pc<br />
<br />
The new install of 3.01 does not overwrite 2.94 / 2.97 at all and but the install file seems to complete properly.<br />
<br />
Upon removing 2.94 and trying a re-install, the install program again seem to run properly , however again nothing actually seems to be created.<br />
<br />
No folder is created in program files x86, no start menu, no program in control panel to uninstall etc.<br />
<br />
I plan to now try going back one version at a time to see when the install starts to work.</div>

<div class="message">Fixed......<br />
<br />
Just as suggested above, i had a silent AV issue with Comodo internet security premium which i have now uninstalled as it has messed me about far too often and was already past its last warning.<br />
<br />
Once removed fully get-iplayer installed without issue.<br />
<br />
Keep up the great work guys</div>

<div class="message">So I uninstalled version 2.94 and then removed everything mentioned in that cleanup document.<br />
<br />
I closed Comodo completely so it wasn't running at all and then tried installing version 3.01 but the problem remains, the installer appears to finish but nothing is created.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else I can do :(</div>

<div class="message">Comodo is a pain.  You either will have to somehow whitelist the file as an install file or better still get rid of comodo like i did.<br />
<br />
It is a pain in the A&#36;&#36; like this, fails to play video files in chromodo, geek buddy is little more than junk etc.<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes is ok though.</div>

<div class="message">Just decided to do a search on the C: Drive for files relating to get_iplayer and it found some files in a hidden folder called C:\VTRoot but I have no idea what this folder is for.<br />
<br />
The cleanup document doesn't mention this folder so I'm not sure whether to try deleting the files I found in there or not</div>

<div class="message">Uninstall Comodo - you know i am right :)<br />
<br />
You could even re-install it again afterwards if you really feel lost without it.<br />
<br />
As you might guess, i will not be re-installing it.</div>

<div class="message">Actually I really like Comodo lol!<br />
<br />
But I sorted it. Even though I closed Comodo there were still a couple of processes running in Task Manager so I clicked the End Task button on those as well and then I was able to install version 3.01 without any issues!<br />
<br />
And I am now downloading the programme I wanted, hopefully it will complete without any issues now<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who helped!</div>
