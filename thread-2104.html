<div class="message">I've just had my gluteus maximus kicked in this forum because I screwed up the installation of the 'get*iplayer' software. I would like to plead ignorance/incompetence as well as being guilty., but I didn't think there were minimum standards of technical competence required before one could use either get*iplayer.<br />
<br />
Now I need to remove multiple versions of get*iplayer - possibly get_iplayer 3.20 and certainly the snap version of get-iplayer 3.22, but I'm quite sure I don't know how to do this - to get a completely "get*iplayer-free" system before attempting to install the non-snap version of get_iplayer 3.22 (assuming that I can find a binary version somewhere). I don't want to get into the position of  having traces of get*iplayer left on my system before trying this re-install, coming back to the forum for help and getting kicked in the rear again for incompetence (or perhaps I have already done that  in this post ....).<br />
<br />
Any advice on how to do the clean-up? I'm running Mint 19.2 Cinnamon.</div>

<div class="message">I don't use snaps, but generically, you can find out what snap packages are installed using<br />
&#36; snap list<br />
and to remove a snap you do<br />
&#36; sudo snap remove &lt;package&gt;<br />
if you get stuck with snaps you'll probably have to seek help elsewhere.<br />
<br />
similarly, to find and remove more conventional packages, do something like this:<br />
&#36; apt list --installed | grep iplayer<br />
and if you find get-iplayer, you can remove it using<br />
&#36; sudo apt purge get-iplayer<br />
<br />
(purge rather than remove cleans out any configuration files as well)<br />
<br />
I'd then suggest you do<br />
&#36; which get_iplayer<br />
and see if get-iplayer is still in your path somewhere, and if it is, start removing those.  Search for<br />
get-iplayer, get_iplayer, get_iplayer_web_pvr and get-iplayer-web-pvr.  If you do find these, you might want to have a poke around for any related files you installed.<br />
<br />
in your home directory have a look for the directory .get_iplayer - this contains your configuration - delete what you don't want.  If you're not sure and want a clean install, you can either delete the whole directory or just rename it.<br />
<br />
You should now be in a place where you have cleaned out all the old versions of get-iplayer.  You now need to decide whether to use the snap version (I can't help with this, sorry), or the conventional repository in launchpad.  Or do something on your own, which I can't recommend but some people have great success with.<br />
<br />
See <a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/unixpkg">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/unixpkg</a> for pointers to packages.<br />
<br />
If you kept any of your previous configuration, I'd suggest you do<br />
&#36; get-iplayer --cache-rebuild<br />
to ensure that the programme cache is up to date.  It'll take a while.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="message">Hello,<br />
Thank you very much for this advice. It is not only consistent with the previous telling-off I got - especially on the subject of using snaps -  but also set at a technical level which correlates well with my own (limited) knowledge, intellectual capability and confidence. <br />
<br />
I'll give it all a try.</div>
