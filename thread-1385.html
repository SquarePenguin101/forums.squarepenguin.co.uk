<div class="message">Folks,<br />
<br />
I have Raspian installed on a R-Pi with version as shown below;<br />
<br />
Linux raspberrypi 4.1.19+ #858 Tue Mar 15 15:52:03 GMT 2016 armv6l GNU/Linux<br />
<br />
Previous version 2.97 (might have been 2.99) was working fine.<br />
<br />
Followed instructions (I think) from the upgrade page and get the following; <br />
<br />
Reading package lists... Done<br />
Building dependency tree        <br />
Reading state information... Done<br />
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br />
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br />
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br />
or been moved out of Incoming.<br />
The following information may help to resolve the situation:<br />
<br />
The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br />
get-iplayer : Depends: perl:any but it is not installable<br />
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. <br />
<br />
This Pi has a number of servers working on it and all are working fine.<br />

This is perl 5, version 20, subversion 2 (v5.20.2) built for arm-linux-gnueabihf-thread-multi-64int<br />
(with 92 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)<br />
<br />
I am running Wheezy, reluctant to upgrade but have many useful local servers running, all of which would require installing and configuring.<br />

<div class="message">Does Raspian differ from Debian enough that upgrades are not seamless? Debian updates are supposed to be smooth as butter, just change the sources to point to the latest release (or I believe it'll do it sort of automatically if you're tracking something like Stable) and dist-upgrade. <br />
<br />
Some Raspberry Pi aficionados to confirm or deny that?</div>

I did try upgrading my pi from wheezy to jessie in-place. once, a long time ago.  I recall it worked ok.  Though to be honest I put a new image on my pi so often it's hard to say whether it was fully stable.  I certainly recall nothing being particularly broken.<br />
<br />
There's some advice <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspbian-jessie-is-here/">on the raspberry pi blog</a>.<br />
<br />
in short<br />
- recommended way to upgrade is to install a fresh image<br />
- there's an unrecommended in-place upgrade path described <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&amp;t=121880">in the raspberrypi forums </a>.<br />
<br />
Given that it's trivially easy to put a fresh image on a fresh SD card, boot from that, try things, and still have the less-than-10-seconds option of putting the old card back in and booting again, I'd tend to suggest just starting again.<br />
<br />
your mileage may vary.<br />

Yes, agree new image is easy as is slipping old SD card back in. Just that I had a good stable setup running quite a few useful servers on my Pi and was reluctant to upgrade just because get_iplayer was not working.<br />
<br />
May install Raspian Jessie Lite and give it a try.<br />

<div class="message">You could just clone the SD-Card and use the cloned to upgrade it to the latest debian / raspian version to see if it works or if you get any errors.<br />
<br />
it's also handy if you've a second r-pi you do it with.. ;)</div>

That's not a bad idea actually.<br />
