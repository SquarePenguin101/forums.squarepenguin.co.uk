<div class="message">Please forgive me if this is a forbidden topic, but it seems relevant.<br />
<br />
In the installation instructions, you recommend not to install Homebrew for the sole purpose of installing get_iplayer, and if you did, remove it.  Why?  Everything is going swimmingly, and I learned a lot.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div>

<div class="message">I can only assume you mean this section then - which is clearly titled 'Upgrading':<br />
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/osx#upgrading">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplay...#upgrading</a><br />
<br />
It comes with the clear explanation:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>Special care must be taken if you are upgrading from a previous manual installation of get_iplayer to a Homebrew installation, or vice versa.</blockquote>
<br />
Now lets look at the sub-section I assume you mean specifically:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>If you are upgrading from a Homebrew installation to a manual installation, run:<br />
<br />
  <kbd>brew uninstall --force get_iplayer</kbd><br />
<br />
to remove get_iplayer before proceeding. If you elect to keep Homebrew on your system, retain the AtomicParsley and ffmpeg from your prior get_iplayer installation with Homebrew - don't try to download and install fresh copies as directed in the manual installation instructions below.<br />
<br />
However, if you previously installed Homebrew and only used it to install get_iplayer, you are strongly recommended to completely remove it along with all applications installed with it, including AtomicParsley and ffmpeg. See <a href="http://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html">http://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html</a> for information on completely uninstalling Homebrew.</blockquote>
<br />
So this recommendation clearly relates to switching from a Homebrew installation to a manual one.<br />
<br />
Let's look at what you said in your first post:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>In the installation instructions, you recommend not to install Homebrew for the sole purpose of installing get_iplayer, and if you did, remove it. </blockquote>
<br />
I still don't see where this is stated. It's states a recommendation to remove Homebrew if you are switching to a manual installation but there is no general recommendation to not install Homebrew simply for the purpose of installing get_iplayer.</div>

<div class="message">Near the top of the same page, under "Homebrew installation", it states:<br />
<br />
 "If you do not understand how Homebrew works, DO NOT install it just to use get_iplayer. Perform a manual installation as described below."<br />
<br />
Well, I don't, but I did it anyway, because the manual installation seemed a lot more complicated.  I am just wondering if there is any harm in leaving Homebrew sitting there.<br />
<br />
I appreciate you giving time to a noob.</div>

<div class="message">The key there is "If you do not understand". If you do or are willing to learn then you should have no issue.<br />
<br />
It's a cost benefit analysis. If you're not willing to learn then you're installing a very large (including xcode which is GBs in size last time I looked) and powerful programme that can alter important parts of your system all for the want of a few lines of copy and pasting if doing it the manual way. <br />
<br />
In general, it's better to keep full understanding of your system and the things that run on it, hence the recommendation to manually install if you're not willing to learn Homebrew. <br />
<br />
That said, you should have minimal ill effects if simply keeping to the relevant Homebrew instructions for updating/managing get_iplayer. It's just not our recommended way.</div>
