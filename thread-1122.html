<div class="message">Hi there<br />
comparing V 2.95 with V 2.97 on both Centos 7  Linux and Windows 10 Pro - V 2.97 seems to take around 30 - 50% longer to download both TV and Radio rather than the previous version V 2.95.<br />
<br />
Currently V 2.95 is still working for the things I generally want to download.<br />
<br />
I've got decent Internet so it's not the ISP / Internet causing this -- and I've tested it on the SAME hardware.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the problem is but with V2.95 I'm getting download speeds of often over 6Mb.s while on V 2.97 for the same file it goes back to around 1.9 - 2.4 Mb/s<br />
<br />
Hopefully there's a fix for this<br />
<br />
Also I see the generated file names have changed from ******.default.mp4  to *****.original.mp4 for TV and equivalent for Radio.  Not a problem though.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div>

<div class="message">Fix for what? You haven't demonstrated you're accessing exactly the same media streams in both versions (you very likely are not). It doesn't matter a bit that you tested on the same hardware. Your machine is unlikely to be the limiting factor. As I and many others can attest, get_iplayer will download much, much faster than 6 Mb/s. Don't assume your upstream conditions are the same everyone else's.</div>

<div class="message">Hi there<br />
<br />
I think there's a confusion here between MegaBYTES / sec and MegaBiITS /sec - my figures should be multiplied by 8 for MegaBITS/sec.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you mean by accessing the same streams<br />
<br />
For TV I use command get_iplayer --get --modes=best --pid=xxxxxxxx  so for the SAME PID I assume it's the same  content being downloaded.<br />
<br />
My downloaded content gets stored on to an SSD so slow Hard Disk access is also unlikely to be a problem<br />
<br />
I really appreciate the work you put in on this great program -- I was just posting my observations which I have repeated several times so I don't think it's anything to do with the ISP Internet variation.<br />
<br />
I know Internet speed is more than adequate -- I can stream full 1080p via VLC or PLEX without any problem - even if transcoding is occasionally needed.<br />
<br />
I know recent W10 updates caused all sorts of hassles with Internet too.<br />
<br />
Is there anything in the command line to increase download speed such as larger transmit packets etc --<br />
<br />
anyway thanks again for all the work you do on this program -- much appreciated by not only me but zillions of others.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div>

In this case, you're wrong in that assumption. Those release notes won't read themselves.</div>

<div class="message">Hi there<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
All fixed now running nicely with great speeds !!<br />
<br />
Bad case of "RTFM" I think I had.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="message">Hi, can I asked what you did to get this fixed? I updated to 2.97 and experienced the same problem. Did you just stick with 2.95 in the end?</div>

<div class="message">I definitely noticed a slow down in download speeds when I upgraded to GIP v2.97 at about the middle of December 2016. I've had some personal things to prevent me from spending more time to investigate so I can't say whether it is all the time or just some of the time that it's slower than before. I'd also be interested in what the solution was as mentioned previously.</div>

<div class="message">Thank You Mr SquarePenguin lol &amp; I'm sure that I can say on behalf of most people on here that we appreciate your time &amp; effort you put into the help &amp; advice that you give to us pilgrims that are not as experienced &amp; knowledgeable as yourself &amp; others like Pinky Dinky lol<br />
Yes, I do know of the new 50fps version compared to the 25fps version download which obviously means a video file that is double in size which consequently means an increase in download time or a slower download speed. But I still thought that I had noticed a difference in the download speed even when using in the CLI at the end of the programme URL that I use, the extension --modes=flash, so that I get an HD download but at 25fps. Again, I could be wrong in thinking it is slower in downloading because I've not given enough time to monitor it closely.</div>
