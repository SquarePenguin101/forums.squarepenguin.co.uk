<div class="message">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Up until maybe a few months ago, get_iplayer was working fine for me. For some reason, even with the latest version installed, whenever I load up get_iplayer, I get the following error messages:<br />

I've tried refreshing / updating the cache, as well as uninstalling completely and reinstalling the program, to no avail. As far as I can tell, nothing is blocking the program. I'm not on any kind of VPN and live within the UK, so nothing should be preventing me from accessing the feeds as far as I can tell. I'm also perfectly able to access the iPlayer website and watch videos there.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, I've read what documentation I can to try to troubleshoot this myself, but I'm honestly stumped.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div>

<div class="message">It doesn't matter that you can use iPlayer site in your browser.  get_iplayer works differently.<br />
<br />
My first guess is that an anti-virus or security package is interfering with access to feeds.Disable all such services and try again. You can also try one of the feed URLs in your browser:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://feeds.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/bbctwo/list/limit/400">http://feeds.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/bbctwo/list/limit/400</a><br />
<br />
If get_iplayer doesn't work with antivirus off but you can download the feed in your browser, try to download the above URL with another command line downloader like wget or curl.  That would help determine if only get_iplayer is affected.<br />
<br />
Also try to download a programme directly with its PID:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer --pid &lt;PID&gt;</code></div></div><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That would help determine if the problem is just with the feeds or with any web access from get_iplayer.</div>

Hi there,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply and my apologies in not replying sooner!<br />
<br />
Using your methodology, I was able to ascertain that the newest version of Comodo was auto-sandboxing the program and hence preventing it accessing the feeds. By adding the get_iplayer folder to the list of exclusions, I have been able to get it workly perfectly.<br />
<br />
In short, within one post you have helped me to solve a problem that I'd been having for months!<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, you have made me both incredibly happy and grateful :)<br />
<br />
Kindest regards</div>
