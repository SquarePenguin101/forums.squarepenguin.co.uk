<div class="message">Someone decided they wanted to lock my thread and ban me  because I don't know how to use a non-Windows Operating System. Why do that? Tell me precisely what you think I did to deserve that; what rule or rules you think I broke to have that happen. I am trying to find help here. I said I am new to ZorinOS, and I am seeking help with things.<br />
<br />
Apparently, the version of get_iplayer I have is old. How can I update it? I have tried <kbd>get_iplayer --update</kbd>, but it tells me<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>ERROR: get_iplayer was installed using the 'apt' package manager.  Please refer to the package manager documentation.</code></div></div><br />
so I tried <kbd>apt get_iplayer --update</kbd> but that told me<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>E: Command line option --update is not understood in combination with the other options</code></div></div><br />
so I am at a loss. How can I get this problem fixed?</div>

With the layout of the forum, seeing the recent threads, I thought others were in this subforum. The mods/admins are drunk on power and need to get a life. The point of having forums is to help people, not to be a dic-ensian dic-tator.<br />

Thank you only; not anyone else (so far).</div>

<div class="message">Try <a href="https://www.squarepenguin.co.uk/downloads/linux/">https://www.squarepenguin.co.uk/downloads/linux/</a><br />
<br />
Note that it uses sudo apt install some-package for standard packages that you probably(?) already have.<br />
It does no harm to do this for well-known programs such as ffmpeg etc<br />
<br />
But do use <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">wget</span> to download the get_iplayer source file.</div>

I nearly fell off the roof ROFLMFAO when I read that. If I could use this forum, if I was allowed to, then I think I might.</div>

The team who maintain get_iplayer have to make continual changes - mostly minor to keep up with continual tinkering by the BBC.<br />

BTW I would uninstall that old version first, that you installed via the repositories.</div>

<br />
<kbd>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jon-hedgerows/get-iplayer<br />
sudo apt-get update</kbd><br />
<br />
which is from the site, before I read what you typed here. Sorry for this. It is complicated. Sometimes you use this, sometimes you use that, sometimes you have to use <kbd>sudo</kbd>, sometimes you don't...but no-one explains <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">clearly</span> why.<br />
<br />
How can I uninstall that what I just did, and instead what should I type with <kbd>wget</kbd> instead? Is it the following?<br />
<br />
<kbd>wget add-apt-repository ppa:jon-hedgerows/get-iplayer<br />
wget apt-get update</kbd><br />

Thank you again!</div>

I just tried getting some help, and I was shot for it. I think I have been quite fair, and my response has been just. There wasn't any indication in the "Warning Level" thing on the left here, either... I am, however, willing to not take it any further.<br />

I know I am being like a complete n00b, and I am one, so I apologise for that. I hate to say this - and I really do hate to say it - but Windows is much simpler. Go to a site, download a programme (though now with 32-bit and 64-bit, they are trying to make it more complicated!), and install it...then use it.</div>

<div class="message">Sudo gives you temporary system (root) access.<br />
Normally programs are installed to root - so <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">apt</span> is always run with sudo.<br />
If you are installing programs to your home directory then you wouldn't use sudo.<br />
<br />
I am unsure how you should uninstall your old get_iplayer since its from an old branch of get_iplayer.<br />
I'd suggest you try:-<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">sudo apt purge get_iplayer</span><br />
But pay close attention to any programs that this may ask you to uninstall. If in doubt cancel the removal and proceed.<br />
<br />
The wget I was referring to can be found on the install instructions.<br />
<br />
I won't comment on the long-running Linux versus Windows controversy. ;)</div>
