<div class="message">Hi,<br />
I regularly record The Radcliffe and Maconie Show on BBC 6 Music and everything has gone fine up until recently.  However, once last week and twice this week it has failed to record.  I have tried it again and get the following message;<br />

It works! Hooray! Great day in the morning!<br />

Uninstalled the previous version and all its components. Reinstalled, dropped in the two patched files from DP at the link above and now Mickey Bradley is back. Christmas has come early. Thanks, guys!<br />

Hi,<br />
I have uninstalled the version I was using (2.9) and downloaded and installed the windows installer from here<br />
<a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/installation#githead">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplay...on#githead</a> but I still seem to have the same problem.  Scott (above) mentions 'dropped in the two patched files' but I'm not sure what those are and how to do it.<br />
Thanks for your help so far.</div>

<div class="message">DP, I think there may be two separate issues here. I was aware of the problem with the Celtic BBC local stations, which has been the case for a while. This current problem is more recent, and seems to affect national Radios 2 and 6Music only. It occurs whether one uses the PVR method or the PID method - the message is as Nimbus reports above.<br />
If I uninstalled my existing Version 2.9 and reinstalled, would that be likely to sort it? I've been on the GitHead page as you suggest, but can't work out how to use it. If I need to do so, could you perhaps give me some pointers? Many thanks.</div>

<div class="message">@nimbus: You're meant to follow the appropriate link UNDER the Git HEAD heading on that page for instructions on how to update your get_iplayer.pl script. The installer won't help.<br />
<br />
@WPW: It's the same problem.  Follow the instructions to update your get_iplayer.pl script.  As I said above, the installer will not help.</div>

<div class="message">Hi,<br />
Right I'm with you now, thanks.  I've followed the instructions on that page and replaced the get_iplayer.pl file in my C:\Program Files (x86) with one that I created from the Git HEAD page.  I get this message when I run get_iplayer;<br />

<div class="message">I'm halfway there, but as a 66-year-old non-programmer need some further guidance! I've managed to save the two GitHead text files, but am not sure how to back up and replace the existing CLI and WPM. Should I type the two lines of instruction in the command line? If so, do I include the word "copy" or is that just for my reference? Is there a space between the two lines (between 'bak' and 'copy')? And do I have admin privileges? <br />
<br />
Or is it just a matter of replacing the old get_iplayer.pl and get_iplayer.cgi files with the new ones by simple cut and paste, as I believe Nimbus has done?<br />
<br />
Any help from anybody appreciated. Many thanks.</div>

</div>
<div class="message">Some answers...<br />
<br />
@nimbus Firstly, select/highlight any code snippets you post here in the new reply box (using the mouse) and then hit the 'code' button. This will tell the site to treat your text as code, format it nicely and stop it getting mangled by escaping or altering some characters. <br />
<br />
Secondly...You wouldn't be able to find that file because it is a file you create, which leads me on to...<br />
<br />
@WPW Yes. You put those commands in their entirety into the command line. You do one after the other. The basic syntax of the first command means:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>COPY the file "InputFileName.cgi" to the file OutputNewFilename.cgi.bak</code></div></div><br />
What you have done is copy the <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer.cgi</code></div></div> file to a new one named <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer.cgi.bak</code></div></div> <br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>.bak</code></div></div> is just a convention for saying this is a backup file, the extension doesn't really mean anything specific. This syntax gets shortened in 'command line speak' to:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>copy "C:&#92;Program Files&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.cgi" get_iplayer.cgi.bak</code></div></div><br />
Then you overwrite the original <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer.cgi</code></div></div> file by copying the new one over the original:<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>copy get_iplayer.cgi "C:&#92;Program Files&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.cgi"</code></div></div><br />
KEY POINT - you use these commands when the 'working directory' is the one where you downloaded the relevant files. The 'working directory' means the one you are currently in. Think of having an explorer window open and the folder 'My Documents' open and displaying in the window. The 'My Documents' folder would be called the 'working directory'.<br />
<br />
A cmd prompt window can also move around to different directories using the <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>cd</code></div></div> (change directory) command. Alternatively you can usually right mouse click on a graphical explorer window and choose the option 'open cmd prompt here'. So, in the guide, when it says to download to the 'working directory' that means you want to make sure that the directory 'open' in the cmd prompt window is the same one where the files are located.<br />
<br />
If you're not familiar moving around on the command line, use the graphical explorer window to get to the right directory and then use the right click and 'open cmd prompt here' trick.<br />
<br />
Notice in the above example how for the original <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>get_iplayer.cgi</code></div></div> file we specify the exact path to it? That's because it's not in the working directory, it's in its original folder, so to copy from or over it we need to specify its exact path. When you don't specify a path to a file, the cmd prompt assums that you are talking about a file in the current working directory or that you want the output (e.g. the .bak file) to be saved to the working directory. <br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up.</div>

<div class="message">Right, almost there, you'll be glad to hear. I've copied the first file in each case, for CLI and WPM - the back-ups. But when I try to copy the second file (.pl and .cgi) the message for both is "the file cannot be copied onto itself". Obviously a basic error, but beyond me to correct at this point. Help!</div>

<div class="message">I can guess at the problem you're facing but if you are running into a problem when running a command, you must post it and details of what exactly you did before the error occured if you are to stand any chance of getting help. This is because we aren't able to stand over your shoulder and see what you are doing, so we must attempt to recreate the problem on our end.<br />

<div class="message">Having read the instructions on this and the github page; I too am having difficulty getting this to work correctly.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the new .pl file in a plain text file to the same Get_iPlayer location of <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer</code></div></div><br />
I've copied the original get_iplayer.pl file to a new .bak file.<br />
<br />
As stated above, <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>copy get_iplayer.pl "C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.pl"</code></div></div> gives a message saying it can't be copied onto itself, so I tried changing the command to <div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>copy get_iplayer.txt</code></div></div><br />
This looks like the file does get copied, but during the process it asks me "Overwrite Yes/No/All?" I answer Yes, and then when I try to download radio show I get errors, which you can see the PL.txt file I've uploaded.</div>

<div class="message">Fair enough - I had actually already read the blog post in question, and was doing my best to be as concise and informative as possible, having first made sure that this particular problem was not dealt with elsewhere. Thanks also for pointing me towards Simon's T's essay.  <br />
<br />
My command was `copy get_iplayer.pl "C:Program Files (x86)\get_iplayer\get_iplayer.pl". The message was 'the file cannot be copied onto itself'. My new .pl file downloaded from GitHead is in My Documents; the old one is in C:\Program Files (x86). Both of those folders are open and minimised.<br />
<br />
Ditto all of the above with get_iplayer.cgi.<br />
<br />
Hope that's OK - not sure what else I can tell you!</div>

<div class="message">Hi,<br />
Thanks for all your help so far.  I noticed that instructions had changed.  I feel like I'm getting there.<br />
<br />
I tried the simple copy and paste method that tvfan suggested, as it seemed the simplest method that I could think of.  However, that didn't work for me (although I was asked for confirmation as per admin privilages).<br />
<br />
I then created some new .pl and .cgi files in a new folder at C:\Test to try again.  I opened a command prompt in Windows 8.1 and pasted the following;<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>cd "C:&#92;Test"<br />
copy "C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.pl" get_iplayer.pl.bak<br />
copy get_iplayer.pl "C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.pl"</code></div></div><br />
<br />
<br />
The outcome was;<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]<br />
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br />
<br />
C:&#92;Users&#92;Steven&gt;cd "C:&#92;Test"<br />
<br />
C:&#92;Test&gt;copy "C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.pl" get_iplayer.pl.<br />
bak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 file(s) copied.<br />
<br />
C:&#92;Test&gt;copy get_iplayer.pl "C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;get_iplayer&#92;get_iplayer.pl"</code></div></div><br />
<br />
<br />
I now have a .bak file in my test folder but interestingly this 'new' get_iplayer.pl file in my main get_iplayer folder is timed at 14/12/14 14:02 (the clean install that I did earlier this afternoon) I actually ran the command prompt at approx. 14/12/14 16:30.  So I'm not sure it was a complete success.  I did the same with the .cgi file and that had the same outcome.<br />
<br />
I then tried to download one of the radio shows that I was having problems with but still no success.<br />
<br />
Thank you for all your help, it is greatly appreciated.</div>
