I have downloaded the latest version of GIP and it still wont download or search for it. <br />
<br />
if I search just for Golf then it brings up all the recent golf programs <br />
<br />
but once the : is included or \: is included then it will not find them</div>

<div class="message">Sorry - Since you asked about escaping a question mark I thought you were referring to a similar problem that appeared on the mailing list. In this case you just need to be aware of which fields you're searching in.  As you should have seen in the "Search in" dropdown list, get_iplayer searches the programme name by default.  If you search for "golf" in the name field you'll see in the results that all the programmes have just "Golf" in the name and "The Open: 2013" as part of the episode name.  If you just want to download programmes related to The Open, the logical thing to do to is change the search field to Episode and use "The Open: 2013" as the search string.  There should be no need to escape the colon in this case.  Of course, all the current programmes with "golf" in the name are about the Open, so none of this may be necessary.</div>

<div class="message">While I see that may well work<br />
there will be other occasions when the program title contains a :<br />
<br />
for instance there is a spike milligan series<br />
<br />
Adolph Hitler: My part in his downfall<br />
<br />
that will be repeated at some point on bbc 4 xtra<br />
<br />
I have a pvr set to record it when it is on<br />
but at present<br />
<br />
<div class="codeblock"><div class="title">Code:</div><div class="body" dir="ltr"><code>search0 Adolph Hitler: My part in his downfall</code></div></div><br />
 will not work<br />
<br />
which is why I was asking if there is a way to use an escape character in the same was as when there is a ? in the program title.</div>

<div class="message">As I said above, use backslash as escape character.  You can escape any character you wish even if it isn't necessary, as is the case for the colons in the examples you cited.   If you perform a search and it gives you the results you expect and then you click "Add Search to PVR", there should be no reason to edit the search string further - you already know it works.  The issue with Who Were the Greeks?  arose because the user employed the "Add Series" link, which saves the search string in a special format that required the ? to be escaped.<br />
<br />
There are only certain conditions that ever require you to escape any characters in a search string.  If you know what regular expressions are (search terms are processed as regular expressions), then you know what those conditions are.  If you don't, then feel free to escape any punctuation characters about which you are unsure.<br />
<br />
And I don't think you can definitively say "Adolph Hitler: My part in his downfall" doesn't work if the programme isn't even available via iPlayer - there is no way to test it.  Just looking at the title, I would guess it's the same issue as with your golf programmes.  "My Part in His Downfall" may get split into the episode field, so you may need to change the field you're searching.</div>

<div class="message">You may simply need to clear your browser cache. With the move it is possible that the some resources need refreshing so a complete clear of browser cache should have everything back the right way for you.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this inconvenience will be tempered by the fact the forum pages should be loading up to 100 times faster! The previous small shared host couldn't handle it and was giving, on average, 5 second page loads. But now on a fast connection pages have the potential to load in under 50ms.</div>
