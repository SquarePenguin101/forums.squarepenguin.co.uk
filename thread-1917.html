<div class="message">Hi all.  Searching has revealed nothing to me specific to this fault, can anyone suggest some things that might be causing it?<br />
<br />
I've just recognized that the reason I have recently been missing the very few TV programmes I record is that the Series or Brand PId's I have in my list for recording don't seem to be recognized as having any programmes associated with them.<br />
<br />
(In addition to a few PVR entries, I have a couple batch files to automate grabbing those one-off PId's that take my interest in the iPlayer web pages...  Trouble is, because it is automated, I don't see when it says "0 total programmes" to me so I've missed a lot recently without realizing it :-[ )<br />
<br />
So, for example, I run get_iplayer (or "Perl get_iplayer.pl" in my batch file) with --Hide --Versions=original,default --pid-recursive --pid=... with the following PId's on separate commandlines:<br />
<br />
p06jy6bc (which is Killing Eve, that the BBC have decided to leave available as an entire series long-term, and to which I get the warning "INFO: 0 total programmes")<br />
p0147qqb (Attenborough the Early Years, which is a single programme so --pid-recursive wouldn't be required even though it is specified, and which downloaded correctly)<br />
p039wcdk (War and Peace, the recent series now available long-term, which gives the same warning)<br />
<br />
What possible settings or options pref's might be causing this unexpected behaviour?  These are new entries in my lists so --Hide should not be having any impact, but I removed it temporarily just to test, with no joy.  I am baffled.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Dranok<br />

P.S.  Using Windows get_iplayer 3.14.0 (with ffmpeg n3.1.2 but that's irrelevant at this point!)</div>

Best to update the latest release to likely solve the issue - and read the 3.15 release notes for info:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/wiki/release310to319#release315">https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplay...release315</a><br />
<br />
(Not that 3.15 is the latest release, just likely relates to the issue you're having)</div>

<div class="message">Well howz-about that then!  A known 'fault' (bless Aunty Beeb for keep-changing-things-to-make-our-life-hard) fixed by the very next version from what I was using...<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for that quick simple solution :-)  I'm now the proud owner of a shiny new 3.17.0.<br />
<br />
As an aside/afterthought:  how do I purge from the cache/history a particular PId so that the package itself will download it again at the allocated time rather than me having to do it manually with --force?  I want to rid myself of a couple of weeks of downloads taking up way too much space in 50fps (that happened before I knew of the change, and came back here to find out what was happening, and added fps25 to my preferences) without doing every single one manually.  I wouldn't mind the work so much, except that some have now gone off iPlayer and I must wait for them to be repeated and grab them automatically when they appear (as they tend to every 3 or 6 months on BBC 4).<br />
<br />
Is there a command I can't find that purges a specific download, or do I really have to scour the download_history or tv.cache manually and delete each entry?  (And if so, do I have to do it in both files?)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time either way...<br />

<div class="message"><blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite><span> (31-10-2018, 11:49 PM)</span></cite>do I really have to scour the download_history or tv.cache manually and delete each entry?</blockquote>Or use <kbd>--force</kbd>, which can be saved in pvr searches as well, though you would want to remove it once you have the desired programmes. Use <kbd>--overwrite</kbd> to replace files if you don't delete them directly.<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite><span> (31-10-2018, 11:49 PM)</span></cite> (And if so, do I have to do it in both files?)</blockquote>Don't touch cache files. They have nothing to do with this.</div>
