<div class="message">Hi,<br />
<br />
apologies if this has already been asked.<br />
<br />
Does get_iplayer allow download of Ultra HD content?<br />
<br />
I am aware that the BBC have released Blue Planet II in UHD to Sky Q Boxes and Smart TVs.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div>

<div class="message">Not likely, from me at least. I don't have a suitable TV to work with, and UHD is only enabled in the TV app afaik. If you can sniff your network traffic, you can probably grab the MPEG-DASH manifest URLs (or HLS playlist equivalents) accessed by your TV and use them with youtube-dl. That is strictly off-topic here, so if you have questions about that approach, take them to a forum where youtube-dl is discussed. There may be other downloaders that can do the job as well.</div>

<div class="message">I've got a Roku Streaming Stick+ - which seems to be the only external player solution enabled for the Beta Blue Planet II HLG UHD trial.<br />
<br />
I sniffed the network traffic (Netgear router with port mirroring upstream of my Wireless access point as the Roku is wifi only) whilst playing a UHD Blue Planet II stream and have the http URLs used for the .mpd manifest, the IS.mp4 and the audio and video .m4s chunks.  <br />
<br />
Whilst I can manually download the .m4s audio and video chunks and the .mp4 (header?) using youtube_dl, I can't seem to automate the process.  (Doing a quick manual download of 20 video .m4s files and the IS.mp4 header and cat-ing them together creates a playable mp4 with HEVC 2160/25p video in it)<br />
<br />
Would having example .mpd (MPEG DASH manifests) help add this functionality to get_iplayer or is this simply not a development priority at the moment?</div>

<div class="message">Thanks for the offer, but I have been able to look at DASH manifests for those programmes that were provided by someone else. The manifests could be accommodated by get_iplayer with some changes, but that isn't the main issue. get_iplayer would need to be able to discover the manifest URLs from the programme PID. As you surmise, it's not a priority - not that I could do anything about it, anyway.</div>

Thanks.  Totally understand.<br />
<br />
I've worked out a way to download the audio and video .mp4 and .m4s chunks in a semi-automated fashion from sniffed URLs, using a text file of URLs, wget and cat to create an audio and video mp4 and then merge them with mkvtoolnix.  Seems to play OK in Kodi on 10-bit HEVC friendly device (and with my TV in manual HLG mode)<br />
<br />
Is there any way of determining the total number of .m4s chunks in an mpeg-dash stream, or do you just keep going until you error? (I've been sniffing the beginning and end of shows to find the highest number .m4s)</div>
