<div class="message">I just upgraded to the latest version of get_iplayer for Windows, I am running windows 7 64-bit, when I run web PVR manager I am getting a message when I select PVR RUN telling me: rtmpdump.exe cannot start due to incompatibility with 64-bit versions of windows, please contact software vendor.<br />
<br />
I have also tried running rtmpdump.exe from the command prompt with exactly the same result. <br />
<br />
Can anybody help?</div>

<div class="message">I don't think you reported the complete error message.  I'll assume it also included "Unsupported 16-bit application", which should give you a clue that something is wrong with your system since rtmpdump would never be a 16-bit application.  The first thing to try is to check for leftovers in autoexec.nt.  See:<br />

<div class="message">Thanks, DinkyPumpkin for your suggestion, however, Win 7 Pro 64-bit does not have a autoexec.nt file. I have attached an image of the error dialog box for your information. Before I installed the new version of get_iplayer the previous version was working OK, however, if I try and re-instal the previous version now it comes up with the same error box as the latest version.<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div>

<div class="message">I have tried adding get_iplayer directory to the PATH, I have also tried starting RTMPdump directly from the rtmpdump directory, the same error occurs in both cases. I am not sure where to look next.</div>

<div class="message">Adding get_iplayer installation dir to PATH won't help.  Needless to say, rtmpdump runs just fine on 64-bit Windows.   I have no idea what was messed up on your particular system that would cause rtmpdump to be misidentified as a 16-bit application.  Maybe you have a misbehaving anti-virus, though I don't know how that would cause this particular error.    get_iplayer obviously doesn't touch any system components, so upgrading or re-installing should be irrelevant.  Only you will know what you've done to your system.  One person reported this same problem to the mailing list, then claimed to have found a solution.  However, when asked she refused to supply that solution, so no further light was shed on the problem.  The only other suggestion I can offer is to try some different rtmpdump binaries.  One alternative (there are no doubt others floating around):<br />

<div class="message">Many thanks, DinkyPumkin, looks like problem is solved with: <a href="https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/releases">https://github.com/K-S-V/Scripts/releases</a> version. Downloading has started without any error reported so far. All I did was unzip and copy the rtmpdump.exe file across to the rtmpdump directory and start Web PVR Manager, bingo!<br />
<br />
I much appreciate your help, hope this helps others who might come across a similar problem.</div>

<div class="message">I would recommend trying the zeranoe build first.  I've just remembered that the ksv build has problems resuming interrupted downloads, which will bite you sooner or later.</div>
