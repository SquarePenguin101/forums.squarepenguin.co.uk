<div class="message">I upgraded to Get_iplayer v2.86 a couple of weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I've got s series of radio programmes and podcasts which I download nightly with a scheduled run of get_iplayer--pvr.<br />
<br />
I've noticed odd problems but I've now found that all the podcasts downloaded since the upgrade are unplayable.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows7 64 Bit.<br />
<br />
I've done some troubleshooting on this and I've found that then the .mp3 file is being downloaded from the web site that the progress indicator on the screen shows that it is downloading ~ 150% of the original mp3 file.<br />
<br />
I can manually download the files using my web browser from the BBC websites using the URLs given and the files saved this way have the correct size and play in vlc.<br />
<br />
I'm attaching a log file for a download of three sample mp3 files using get_iplayer--pvr.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd be grateful if anyone has any suggestions as to what's going wrong.<br />

New podcast programme: 'Law in Action - Law: Cross-Examination in the Pistorius Trial 12 Jun 14', 'Would the combative cross-examination techniques employed by prosecutor Gerrie Nel in the Oscar Pistorius trial be allowed in the UK - and would they prove counter-productive? Also: The Court of Appeal has ruled against an attempt to hold a criminal trial entirely in secret - are secret trials ever justified? And should we be using acts of parliament to change public perception?<br />
 Finally, is Magna Carta treated with greater reverence in the United States than it is in the United Kingdom?'<br />

New podcast programme: 'Law in Action - Law: Policing Social Media 24 June 14', 'Cyber-bullying is becoming more and more common - and the police are often the first to hear about it. Joshua Rozenberg asks just how much time are the policespending on dealing with social media disputes? Also: The Washington Redskins has had some of its trademarks cancelled on the basis that the team's name is derogatory to Native Americans - what does this mean for one of American football's most-famous franchises? And: the story of BritainÃÃÃs most-expensive private prosecution, which cost the businessman who brought it around â¬Ãº1 million. Finally: Should humans be the only species with legal rights? We speak to the man fighting for the rights of Chimpanzees in the New York courts.'</div>
