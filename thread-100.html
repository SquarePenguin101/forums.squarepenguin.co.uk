<div class="message">Hiya,<br />
<br />
Since last night i had the following issue which leads up to rtmp totally crashing on win 8.1 x64. My installation fetched a recording without issue yesterday at 20:35 and there have been no changes to the machine after that successful fetch. Therefore, I am puzzled why this episode is producing fault... now, if there is an error with downloading, then i would expect the error to be caught so that the full on rtmp crash didn't occur (see event log report at end of console output).<br />
<br />
Muchos thanks.<br />

<div class="message">rtmpdump will fail sometimes.  rtmpdump will crash sometimes.  There is nothing you can do about it, and there is nothing get_iplayer can do about it.  get_iplayer makes a number of attempts to resume and complete problem downloads, but often it simply won't work.  Any number of things can cause rtmpdump problems, but they rarely can be diagnosed and virtually never can be diagnosed remotely.  Just delete any partial download and start over.<br />
<br />
If rtmpdump crashes inordinately often, you can try an alternate build.  See the instructions I gave here:<br />
