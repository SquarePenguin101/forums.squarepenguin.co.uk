Try opening some of those URLs in your browser.  It looks like there is a problem with upstream connectivity, or perhaps with DNS.</div>

<div class="message">You get those errors after each failed attempt to download a schedule file (3 total, with 20 second timeout).  Browsers are probably more forgiving than Perl, but this still points to upstream problems. The failed files aren't the same for tvfan and jfaust, which also suggests the problem is intermittent and lies between user and BBC.  If there were persistent problems at the BBC end, SP and I should get similar results.   Both tvfan and jfaust appear to be on Virgin Media, so the similar problems may not be a coincidence.</div>

Even with a VPN though you are still going through the same Virgin Media connection. As we are both seeing the same sort of errors though, I'm guessing it's a wider spread VM network issue than our connections.<br />
<br />
Dinky also mentioned DNS earlier and if it worked through the VPN, that probably uses different DNS lookup methods to the VM methods so that sounds more like it could be the issue.<br />
<br />
Also, while the TV cache is failing, the radio cache is refreshing with no issues.</div>

Sort of, you'll get an encrypted tunnel to the VPN provider over VM's network but to the web and the BBC you'll appear to 'be' the VPN. So if the issue is with VM network accessing the BBC content you'd be effectively bypassing (or tunnelling past) VM if you use the VPN.<br />
<br />
Upshot is a VPN would effectively resolve this issue if the problem resides within VM's network. <br />
<br />
It would have the side effect of solving a DNS issue if the two services used different DNS resolution. <br />
<br />
If it is a DNS issue you could try changing yours yourself and seeing the results.</div>

<div class="message">You only need to worry about these warnings if all 3 attempts to download any schedule file fail. My earlier post was unclear on this.  If you only saw 1-2 warnings for any given file, as was the case here, then the download ultimately succeeded and that file's data was cached.  The warnings indicated that some download attempts failed, but they were only a small fraction of the total.  There may be an overloaded switch or something like that upstream at Virgin, but it appears to be only a minor annoyance at the moment. To investigate further, you would need to employ a debugging proxy or network capture application like Wireshark.  You might also test with curl or wget to see if you can get similar failures with another command line downloader.</div>

<div class="message">This may or may not be relevant, but I received something similar on my Mint box after the update to 2.94 what I did was to refresh a couple of single channels....did this a few times and then the cache seemed to update itself with the usual get-iplayer, no more problems since.</div>
