<div class="message">I'm posting this under the Windows forum because I'm using Windows 8.1.<br />
The problem I've come across is not a get_iplayer problem (I really don't think) irrespective of what version of G.I.P. is being used.<br />
As there is only one day left to download the Eastenders programme which was originally shown on the 27/03/17, I tried downloading it using the C.L.I. &amp; using the URL,<br />
i.e.<br />
get_iplayer --url <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08l429m/eastenders-27032017">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08...s-27032017</a> --tvmode=flashbetter<br />
and this is what I get.<br />
WARNING: No media streams for requested programme versions and recording modes.<br />
And even when I try to download it just using,<br />
get_iplayer --url <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08l429m/eastenders-27032017">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08...s-27032017</a><br />
I get the following message.<br />
INFO: No versions of this programme were selected &lt;available versions: audiodescribed&gt;<br />
So I typed,<br />
get_iplayer --url <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08l429m/eastenders-27032017">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b08...s-27032017</a> --info<br />
and it returned only AD versions available.<br />
But what is confusing is that I had no problem with the episode shown on the 23/03/17 &amp; the episode on the 28/03/17 or any previous episodes. I haven't tried any after the 28/03/17 yet.<br />
I don't expect this to be anything at all to do with G.I.P. &amp; as far as I know I've never experienced it before with any programme that is still within the 29/30day expiry period.<br />
So can anyone enlighten me in what may be happening?<br />
And let me finally say that the AD &amp; SIGNED programmes are a curse to me. Most often I've missed a programme &amp; then when I see it is available I'm all excited that I can finally download it only to find it is only available as an AD OR SIGNED. I think that the BBC  should have a dedicated channel with AD &amp; SIGNED versions for the disabled people &amp; leave the normal channels with the normal versions for normal people. It seems at times there are more AD &amp; SIGNED versions available than normal ones.</div>

<br />
Yes, the BBC haven't made the non audio described version available, so the only one available is an audio described version. It happens a lot. <br />

<br />
Boo hoo. Go and cry to the BBC about it. That attitude is not welcome here for it's blatant discriminatory tone, let alone the irrelevance of the statement to get_iplayer. <br />
<br />
For the avoidance of doubt, please read the forum rules and adhere to point 14.</div>
