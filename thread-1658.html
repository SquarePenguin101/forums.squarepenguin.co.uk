<div class="message">Hi guys<br />
<br />
I'm not an expert with get_iplayer so please bear with me.<br />
<br />
I used to use version 2.97 on windows 7, which worked fine.<br />
<br />
After installing windows 10, and get_iplayer 3.12, I get a load of warnings:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">WARNING: Failed to download schedule page</span> (a long list of these)<br />
<br />
When I type <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">get_iplayer --pid=b087vhpv</span> for example, I get:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">WARNING: Failed to download JSON PID info: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087vhpv.json">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b087vhpv.json</a><br />

<br />
Any ideas? Thanks in advance.</div>

The issue was that Kaspersky was blocking Perl. Check your anti-virus isn't doing the same.</div>

Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I had ESET installed on windows 7 and it worked fine, why would it be different on win10?<br />
<br />
Also I have tried without the ESET installed, it's still not working.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas?</div>

Thanks for your response. Apologies for my ignorance, I am following the guide steps this time, so here goes:<br />
<br />
1. I'm expecting to be able to download a programme by the PID, instead the programme does not download.<br />
<br />
2. get_iplayer version: 3.12.0<br />
<br />
3. Windows 10 version 1607, (also tried 1709)<br />
<br />
4. This is the command I'm using: get_iplayer --pid=p05t6btv<br />
<br />
5. The programme is called "Plastic Surgery Capital of the World", the URL is: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p05t6btv/plastic-surgery-capital-of-the-world">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0...-the-world</a>, it's only 1 episode and not a series.<br />
<br />
6. U:\&gt;get_iplayer --pid=p05t6btv<br />

7. When I try this it says "Access is denied."</div>

Did you remove <kbd>%USERNAME%</kbd> from the example command? That's not a placeholder, it's there to select your home folder. If you didn't, change the path to a location your user has access to, like the desktop or something.</div>

<div class="message">So you actually just copy and pasted the example command instead of using the pid you're having trouble with and appending the required arguments to create the log. <br />
<br />
This is explained in the paragraph before the example command. <br />
<br />
That said, there's enough there to see enough of what's going on. <br />
<br />
What ISP are you using to connect to iPlayer? You can actually go to the iPlayer site itself and play a programme without any problem? <br />
<br />
I ask because the IP address you're using to comment here suggests you're sat behind an ISP that provides education services, so I wouldn't be surprised if iPlayer was blocked on that network.</div>

Apologies for my stupidity.<br />
<br />
The error is the same with all the PIDs as I cannot access anything.<br />
<br />
The ISP is RM Education going through Virgin. But yes getting to the iplayer site is no problem, and even playing the programmes isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
Forgive my ignorance, but wouldn't iplayer not work on Windows 7 as well if it was blocked?</div>

I read from you mentioning you used to use version 2.97 on Win 7 that that would have been some time ago as that's quite an old version of get_iplayer. <br />
<br />
If you are currently able to use get_iplayer on a Win 7 machine but not the Win 10 one then that would point to something peculiar to that particular Win 10 machine. Nothing from the log says what that might be as far as I can see, other than showing that some component or get_iplayer/network access is being blocked. <br />
<br />
Most commonly this is caused by a firewall rule or anti-virus, sometimes the anti virus blocks the installation of certain components during the install process but gives no indication it's done this. Other times various other programmes can change the PATH contents and a myriad of other things. <br />
<br />
There's no specific advice I can give other than start from a known good state and then go from there, testing after each change. <br />
<br />
get_iplayer certainly works on Win 10 so it indicates something unique to your particular setup which I can't predict.</div>
